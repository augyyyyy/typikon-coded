This expanded roadmap transforms your foundational re-analysis into a rigorous testing suite. Each question is designed to "break" the AI’s logic, forcing it to account for the specific depth of the **Dolnytsky Typikon**.

## V. Theorized Use Cases (5 New Roles)

1. **The Sacristan (Altar Guild):** Focus on the "Physical Environment."
* *Question:* Does the app generate a "Vestment Color Report" for the week so the sacristan knows when to change the Altar cloths?


2. **The Layperson (Pew-Side):** Focus on "Active Participation."
* *Question:* Can the app hide the "Silent Prayers" and "Rubrics" to provide a clean, readable text for someone just following the service?


3. **The Choirmaster (Technical Music):** Focus on "Sheet Music and Tones."
* *Question:* Does the app link to the specific musical notation or PDF for the Tone of the week for every hymn?


4. **The Catechist (Educational):** Focus on "Theological Explanation."
* *Question:* Does the app provide a "Why are we doing this?" sidebar that explains the history of a specific rubric as the user scrolls?


5. **The Bell-Ringer (Typikon of Bells):** Focus on "The Call to Prayer."
* *Question:* Does the app specify the "Blahovist" (slow tolling) vs. "Tretehny" (ringing of all bells) based on the Rank of the day?
