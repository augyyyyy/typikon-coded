Based on the **Dolnytsky Typikon** (Parts 1 and 2), here is the fully unabridged structural outline for **Sunday Nocturns (Polunoschnitsa nedilna)**.

This structure is used exclusively on **Sunday Mornings**. Its defining characteristic is the **omission of the Psalter (Psalm 118)** and its replacement by the **Canon to the Holy Trinity**, emphasizing the Resurrectional character of the day.

### **Service Selector Logic**

* **Trigger:** Sunday Morning.
* **Condition:** Used only if an **All-Night Vigil was NOT served**. (If a Vigil was served, Nocturns is omitted in church use, though often read privately by the clergy).
* **Exclusion:** Bright Sunday (Pascha) through Thomas Sunday (Use `struct_nocturn_paschal`).

### **I. The Enarxis (Opening)**

* **The Blessing:** "Blessed is our God..."
* **The Usual Beginning:**
* **Resolve Case A (Standard):** "Glory to Thee... O Heavenly King... Trisagion... O Come Let Us Worship..."
* **Resolve Case B (Ascension to Pentecost):** Omit "O Heavenly King."


* **Psalm 50:** "Have mercy on me, O God."

---

### **II. The Canon to the Trinity (The Sunday Variable)**

* **Logic Gate (Octoechos Part 2):** Unlike Daily Nocturns, which uses the fixed Psalm 118, Sunday Nocturns requires a variable Canon.
* **The Canon:**
* **Action:** Insert **Canon to the Holy Trinity** in the **Tone of the Week** (1–8).
* **Source:** **Octoechos** (Sunday Office).
* **Structure:**
* Ode 1, Ode 3.
* **Sessional Hymns (Sedalni):** "We Thy servants..." (Fixed Text).
* Ode 4, Ode 5, Ode 6.
* **Kontakion & Oikos:** "Thou has shown, O Three in One..." (Fixed Text).
* Ode 7, Ode 8, Ode 9.




* **The Megalynaria (It's truly proper):**
* **Resolve Case:** "It is truly proper to glorify thee, the Word of God..." (Special Trinity Megalynaria found in the Horologion/Octoechos).



---

### **III. The Trisagion & Hymnody**

* **The Trisagion:** Standard sequence ("Holy God... All-Holy Trinity... Our Father...").
* **The Troparion Slot (The Hypakoe):**
* **Resolve Case (Tone of the Week):**
* **Action:** Insert the **Hypakoe** of the Resurrectional Tone.
* **Source:** **Octoechos** (Sunday Matins materials).
* *Note:* The standard penitential Troparia of Daily Nocturns ("Behold the Bridegroom") are **suppressed**.





---

### **IV. The Prayers of the Holy Trinity**

* **Kyrie:** "Lord, have mercy" (40 times).
* **The Prayer of the Hours:** "Thou Who at all times..."
* **The Closing Prayer:**
* **Action:** Insert the **Prayer to the Holy Trinity** ("O All-Creating and Life-Giving Trinity...").
* *Note:* This replaces the Prayer of St. Mardarius found in Daily Nocturns.



---

### **V. The Second Part (OMITTED)**

* **Logic Gate:**
* **Instruction:** **STOP.**
* **Reason:** Sunday Nocturns has **NO Second Part** (The Prayer for the Dead). The commemoration of the dead is structurally incompatible with the Resurrectional joy of Sunday.



---

### **VI. The Dismissal**

* **The Dismissal Proper:**
* **Type:** **Small Dismissal**.
* **Formula:** "May **Christ our True God, risen from the dead**, through the prayers of His Most Pure Mother..." (Resurrectional Preamble is mandatory).


* **The Litany:**
* "Let us pray for the Ecumenical Pontiff..." (Standard closing litany).
* *Note:* The Litany for the Dead ("Have mercy on us, O God...") is **strictly omitted**.
