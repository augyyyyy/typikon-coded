Based on the **Dolnytsky Typikon** (specifically **Part 4: Triodion** and **Part 1: General Order**), here is the fully unabridged structural outline for **Lenten Matins (Utrenya postova)**.

This structure is used exclusively on **Weekdays (Monday–Friday) of Great Lent**.

**Critical Distinction:** Unlike Daily Matins, Lenten Matins features the **Alleluia** (replacing "God is the Lord"), the **Hymns to the Trinity** (Troichni), and the **Prayer of St. Ephrem**. Furthermore, the structural order of the Ending is unique.

### **Service Selector Logic**

* **Trigger:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday of Great Lent.
* **Exclusion:** Saturday of Lent (All Souls / Akathist) -> Load `struct_matins_festal` (God is the Lord is restored).
* **Exclusion:** Sunday of Lent -> Load `struct_matins_festal`.

---

### **I. The Royal Office (The Enarxis)**

* **Logic Gate (Connection to Nocturns):**
* **Monastic Rule:** If Nocturns was just served, the Royal Office is omitted.
* **Parish Rule:** Begin with "Blessed is our God..."


* **The Royal Psalms (19 & 20):** Read.
* **The Troparia:** "O Lord, save Thy people..."
* **The Censing:** The whole church.

---

### **II. The Six Psalms (Hexapsalmos)**

* **The Opening:** "Glory to God in the highest..." (3 times).
* **The Reading:** Psalms 3, 37, 62, 87, 102, 142.
* **The Great Litany:** "In peace let us pray to the Lord..."

---

### **III. The Alleluia & Trinity Hymns (The Lenten Marker)**

* **The Proclamation:**
* **Action:** **REPLACE** "God is the Lord" with **"Alleluia"**.
* **Rubric:** Sung in the **Tone of the Week**.
* **Verses:** Used with the funeral/lenten verses ("My spirit seeks Thee early in the morning...").


* **The Troparia Slot (The Troichni):**
* **Action:** **REPLACE** the Saint's Troparion with the **Hymns to the Trinity (Troichni)** in the Tone of the Week.
* **Structure:**
1. Hymn to the Father.
2. Hymn to the Son.
3. Hymn to the Spirit.


* **Theotokion:** The concluding Hymn to the Theotokos.



---

### **IV. The Psalter (Kathismata)**

* **Logic Gate (Lenten Quantity):**
* **Standard Daily:** 2 Kathismata.
* **Lenten Rule:** **3 Kathismata** are appointed (to cover the Psalter twice a week).
* **Sequence (Part 4):**
* **Monday:** Kathisma 4, 5, 6.
* **Tuesday:** Kathisma 7, 8, 9.
* **Wednesday:** Kathisma 10, 11, 12.
* **Thursday:** Kathisma 13, 14, 15.
* **Friday:** Kathisma 18, 19, 20.




* **The Sessional Hymns (Sedalni):**
* Read after each Kathisma.
* **Source:** **Triodion** (Joseph/Theodore/Apostles) takes precedence, or the **Octoechos** (Penitential/Martyria).


* **Psalm 50:** Read.

---

### **V. The Canon (The Triodion Variable)**

* **Structure:** This is the most complex logic gate. The **Triodion** contains only **3 Odes** (hence the name "Three-Odes"), which disrupt the standard 9-Ode structure.
* **Biblical Canticles:**
* **Rubric:** The Scriptural Odes (Moses, Anna, Habakkuk, etc.) are **SUNG** in full, which is rare in non-Lenten services.


* **The Composition Logic:**
* **If Triodion has Ode X:** The Menaion/Octoechos for that Ode are **Omitted** or combined, and the **Triodion** takes the main slot.
* **If Triodion is absent for Ode X:** Read Menaion/Octoechos.


* **The Katavasia:**
* **Standard:** "I shall open my mouth..." (or Lenten equivalent).


* **The Inter-Ode Hymns:**
* **After Ode 3:** Little Litany + Sessional Hymn (Menaion/Triodion).
* **After Ode 6:** Little Litany + Kontakion (Saint/Triodion).


* **The Magnificat (Ode 9):** Sung.

---

### **VI. The Praises (Lauds)**

* **The Psalms (148-150):**
* **Rubric:** Read (Recited), not sung. "Praise the Lord from the heavens..."


* **The Stichera on the Praises:**
* **Action:** Usually **Omitted** on Lenten Weekdays unless a specific Feast coincides.
* **Replacement:** Often proceeded directly to the Doxology.



---

### **VII. The Doxology & Litany (Lenten Order Swap)**

* **Critical Structural Change:** In Lenten Matins, the Doxology comes **BEFORE** the Litany and Aposticha.
* **The Doxology:**
* **Type:** **Small Doxology** (Read). "To Thee belongs glory..."


* **The Litany of Supplication:**
* "Let us complete our morning prayer..."



---

### **VIII. The Aposticha (The Displacement)**

* **Position:** Occurs here (End of Service).
* **Source:** **Triodion** (Idiomelon of the Day) takes precedence.
* **Structure:** Hymn -> Verse -> Hymn -> Verse -> Hymn -> Glory -> Both Now.


* **The "It is Good" Hymn:**
* **Action:** "It is good to give praise to the Lord..." (Psalm 91:1) is read **TWICE**.


* **The Trisagion:** "Holy God..."

---

### **IX. The Conclusion (The Lenten Ending)**

* **The Troparia:**
* **Action:** The standard Troparia are replaced by the **"Standing in the Temple"** sequence.
* 1. "Standing in the temple of thy glory..."


* 2. "Lord, have mercy" (40 times).


* 3. "Glory... Both Now..."


* 4. "More Honorable than the Cherubim..."


* 5. "In the name of the Lord, Father, bless."




* **The Priest's Blessing:** "Christ our God, the Existing One..."
* **The Prayer of St. Ephrem:**
* **Logic Gate (Part 4):**
* **Standard:** Recited with **3 Prostrations**.
* **Clean Week:** Recited with **16 Prostrations** (4 large, 12 small).




* **The Dismissal:**
* **Omitted:** There is usually **NO Dismissal** here.
* **Transition:** The **First Hour** is attached immediately. "Come, let us worship..." begins the First Hour.
* *(Note: The actual Dismissal occurs at the end of the First Hour in Lenten practice).*
