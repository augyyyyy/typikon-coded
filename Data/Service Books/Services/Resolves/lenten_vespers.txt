Based on the **Dolnytsky Typikon** (specifically Part 4: Triodion), here is the fully unabridged structural outline for **Lenten Vespers (Vechirnya postova)**.

This structure is distinct because of its penitential character, the inclusion of Old Testament readings (Genesis and Proverbs), and the specific "Lenten Ending" with prostrations.

### **Service Selector Logic**

* **Trigger Condition A (Sunday Evening):** Served on Sunday evenings of Great Lent (e.g., Forgiveness Sunday). Features the **Great Prokeimenon**.
* **Trigger Condition B (Weekday):** Served on Monday through Friday of Great Lent. Features **Genesis and Proverbs** readings.
* **Trigger Condition C (Presanctified Connection):** If the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts follows (Wed/Fri), the service morphs after the readings. *This outline covers the Vespers portion up to that divergence.*

### **I. The Enarxis (Opening)**

* **The Blessing:** "Blessed is our God..."
* **The Usual Beginning:**
* "Glory to Thee... O Heavenly King... Trisagion... O Come Let Us Worship..."


* **Psalm 103:** Read (Recited) or sung simply.
* **The Great Litany:** "In peace let us pray to the Lord..."

---

### **II. The Kathisma (The Psalter)**

* **Logic Gate (Part 4 - Triodion):**
* **Resolve Case A (Sunday Evening):** No Kathisma is read (standard parish practice) or 1st Kathisma (monastic).
* **Resolve Case B (Weekday):** The **18th Kathisma** ("To the Lord in my distress") is appointed for Lenten weekdays.
* **Resolve Case C (Friday Evening):** The 18th Kathisma is read (if not read at Matins), or sometimes no Kathisma if Vigil follows.



---

### **III. "Lord, I Have Cried" (The Stichera)**

* **The Psalms (140, 141, 129, 116):** Sung in the Tone of the Week or the Tone of the Triodion idiomela.
* **The Stichera "On Count" Logic:**
* **Sunday Evening:** **10 Stichera** (4 Octoechos + 3 Triodion + 3 Menaion).
* **Weekday:** **6 Stichera** (3 Triodion + 3 Menaion).
* *Note:* The Triodion (Part 4) usually supplies specific "Idiomela" (Unique Melodies) for the day.




* **The "Glory" Slot:**
* **Sunday:** Glory... Both now... (Theotokion).
* **Weekday:** Glory... Both now... (Theotokion of the Triodion or Menaion).


* **The Entrance Logic:**
* **Sunday Evening:** **Great Prokeimenon Entrance** (Censer used).
* **Weekday:** **No Entrance** (Priest stands at the Royal Doors).
* *Exception:* If serving Presanctified, the Entrance with the Censer (or Gospel) occurs *after* the Stichera.





---

### **IV. The Readings & Prokeimena (Part 4)**

* **The "Gladsome Light":** Read (Weekday) or Sung (Sunday).
* **The Prokeimenon Slot 1:**
* **Sunday Evening:** **The Great Prokeimenon** (e.g., "Turn not away Thy face"). *Stop readings here.*
* **Weekday:** Prokeimenon from the **Triodion** (Psalm verse).


* **The Reading Slot 1 (Weekday Only):**
* **Source:** **Book of Genesis** (Sequential reading).
* **Pointer:** `[REF: Triodion_Genesis_Reading_Day_X]`.


* **The Prokeimenon Slot 2 (Weekday Only):**
* **Source:** Second Prokeimenon from the Triodion.


* **The Reading Slot 2 (Weekday Only):**
* **Source:** **Book of Proverbs** (Sequential reading).
* **Pointer:** `[REF: Triodion_Proverbs_Reading_Day_X]`.


* **Presanctified Divergence:**
* *If Presanctified:* "Let my prayer be set forth..." is sung here.
* *If Vespers Only:* Continue below.



---

### **V. The Post-Readings Sequence**

* **Vouchsafe, O Lord:** Read.
* **Litany of Supplication:** "Let us complete our evening prayer..."

---

### **VI. The Aposticha**

* **The Hymn Slot:**
* **Source:** **Triodion** (Idiomelon of the Day).
* **Structure:** Hymn -> Verse 1 -> Hymn (Martyrs) -> Verse 2 -> Hymn -> Glory/Both Now.


* **The "Glory... Both Now..." Logic:**
* **Resolve:** Triodion text takes precedence over Octoechos on weekdays.



---

### **VII. The Lenten Ending (The "Rejoice" Triad)**

* **Logic Gate:** This section replaces the standard Troparia on Lenten Weekdays and Sunday Evenings (if indicated).
* **Song of Simeon:** "Now Thou lettest Thy servant depart..."
* **The Lenten Troparia (Sung with Prostrations):**
1. "Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos, Mary full of grace..." (Prostration).
2. "O Baptizer of Christ, remember us..." (Prostration).
3. "Plead for us, O Holy Apostles..." (Prostration).
4. "Beneath thy compassion we take refuge..." (No Prostration).


* *Note:* On Sunday Evenings, the prostrations may be suspended depending on the specific week, but the hymns remain.



---

### **VIII. The Dismissal**

* **Kyrie:** "Lord, have mercy" (40 times).
* **Prayer:** "More honorable than the Cherubim..."
* **The Prayer of St. Ephrem (Part 4):**
* **Logic:** Recited with **3 or 16 prostrations** depending on the degree of fasting for the week.


* **The Dismissal Proper:**
* **Type:** **Lenten Dismissal**.
* **Formula:** "Christ our True God, through the prayers of His Most Pure Mother... and of all the Saints..."
