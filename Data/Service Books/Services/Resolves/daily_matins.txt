Based on the **Dolnytsky Typikon** (Parts 1–5), here is the fully unabridged structural outline for **Daily Matins (Utrenya shodenna)**.

This structure covers standard weekdays (**Monday–Saturday**) when no Great Feast or Polyeleos Rank Saint occurs.

**Crucial Logic Note:** The defining characteristic of Daily Matins in Dolnytsky is that the **Doxology is Read** (not sung) and the **Aposticha** are moved to the *end* of the service (after the Litany).

### **Service Selector Logic**

* **Trigger:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.
* **Condition:** Saint Rank is 0 (Simple), 1 (Six Stichera), or 2 (Doxology).
* **Exclusion:** If Rank 3 (Polyeleos) or higher, load `struct_matins_festal`.
* **Exclusion:** If Lenten Weekday (Alleluia), load `struct_matins_lenten`.

### **I. The Royal Office (The Enarxis)**

* **The Blessing:** "Blessed is our God..."
* **The Royal Psalms (19 & 20):**
* **Logic:** Read daily unless Matins is served immediately after Nocturns (monastic practice), in which case they are omitted.


* **The Troparia:** "O Lord, save Thy people..."
* **The Censing:** Priest censes the Holy Table and the whole church.

### **II. The Six Psalms (Hexapsalmos)**

* **The Opening:** "Glory to God in the highest..." (3 times).
* **The Reading:** Psalms 3, 37, 62, 87, 102, 142.
* *Rubric:* Read with compunction; no movement or making the sign of the cross.


* **The Great Litany:** "In peace let us pray to the Lord..."

---

### **III. "God is the Lord" & Troparia**

* **The Proclamation:**
* **Resolve Case A (Standard):** "God is the Lord..." sung in the **Tone of the Saint** (Menaion) or **Tone of the Week** (Octoechos).
* **Resolve Case B (Saturday):** Sung in Tone 2 (usually) for the Apostles/Martyrs/Dead.


* **The Troparia Stack:**
* **Scenario A (Mon-Fri):**
* Troparion of the Saint (Menaion) x2.
* Glory... Both now...
* Theotokion of the Tone (from the Menaion or Octoechos).


* **Scenario B (Saturday - The Memorial):**
* "Apostles, Martyrs, and Prophets..." (Tone 2).
* Glory... "Remember, O Lord, as Thou art good..." (Troparion of the Dead).
* Both now... "O Holy Mother of the Ineffable Light..."


* **Scenario C (Forefeast):**

---

### **V. Psalm 50**

* **Rubric:** Read.

---

### **VI. The Canon (The Hymnography)**

* **Logic Gate (Part 2 - Composition):**
* **Standard Rule:** 3 Canons are typically read.
* **Mon-Thu:**
1. Canon of Repentance (Octoechos).
2. Canon of the Day (Octoechos - e.g., Angels on Mon).
3. Canon of the Saint (Menaion).


* **Saturday:**
1. Canon of the Prophets/Martyrs (Octoechos).
2. Canon of the Dead (Octoechos).
3. Canon of the Saint (Menaion).


* **Forefeast:** Canon of the Feast usually replaces Octoechos Canons.


* **Biblical Odes:** The Canticles of Moses are usually sung on weekdays.
* **Katavasia:**
* **Daily:** Usually **Omitted** (Irmos of the last Canon is repeated).
* **Feast Period:** Katavasia of the Season may be appointed.


* **The Inter-Ode Hymns:**
* **After Ode 3:** Small Litany + Sessional Hymn (Menaion).
* **After Ode 6:** Small Litany + Kontakion/Ikos (Saint).


* **The Magnificat (Ode 9):**
* "My soul magnifies the Lord" is sung.



---

### **VII. The Praises (Lauds)**

* **The Psalms (148-150):**
* **Resolve Case A (Mon-Fri):** Read (Recited) simply. "Praise the Lord from the heavens..."
* **Resolve Case B (Saturday):** SUNG.


* **The Stichera on the Praises:**
* **Mon-Fri:** Usually **Omitted** in Daily Matins.
* **Saturday:** **Stichera of the Praises** (Octoechos - Martyrs/Apostles) are sung.


* **The Doxology Logic (The Daily Marker):**
* **Resolve Case A (Mon-Fri):** **Small Doxology** (Read). "To Thee belongs glory... Glory to God in the highest..."
* **Resolve Case B (Saturday):** **Small Doxology** (Read).
* *Exception:* If the Saint is Rank 2 (Doxology Rank), the **Great Doxology** is Sung, and the service morphs into a hybrid Festal structure.





---

### **VIII. The Litany of Supplication**

* **Text:** "Let us complete our morning prayer..."
* *Note:* In Daily Matins, this Litany occurs *before* the Aposticha.

---

### **IX. The Aposticha (The Displacement)**

* **Logic:** In Daily Matins, the Aposticha are moved to this position (End of Service).
* **Source:**
* **Mon-Fri:** **Stichera of the Day** (Octoechos).
* **Saturday:** **Stichera of the Dead** (The Nekrosima from Octoechos).
* **Forefeast:** Stichera of the Feast (Menaion).


* **The "Glory... Both Now...":**
* Glory: Saint (if available) or Octoechos.
* Both Now: Theotokion.

### **X. The Dismissal Sequence**

* **The "It is good" Hymn:** "It is good to give praise to the Lord..." (Psalm 91:1).
* **The Trisagion:** "Holy God..."
* **The Final Troparia:**
* **Mon-Fri:** Troparion of the Saint -> Glory... Both Now... Theotokion.
* **Saturday:**
* "Apostles, Martyrs, and Prophets..."
* Glory... "Remember, O Lord, as Thou art good..."
* Both Now... "O Holy Mother..."




* **Litany of Fervent Supplication:** "Have mercy on us, O God..."
* **The Dismissal Proper:**
* **Type:** **Small Dismissal**.
* **Formula:** "Christ our True God... through the prayers of the Saint of the Day..."
* **Saturday Addition:** Includes commemoration of the Dead ("...and establish the souls of Your servants...").
