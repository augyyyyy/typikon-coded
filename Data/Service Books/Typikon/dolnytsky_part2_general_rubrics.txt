Note
A Saint without Polyeleos may be [sung] on 4 or on 6. The designation of a saint "on 4" or "on 6" depends on the number of troparia in each Ode of his Canon at Matins. There are three cases of a Saint without Polyeleos: that is, there may occur only one saint on 4, or two on 4, or one on 6. When we say one or two saints, we understand them as having separate services, for there may be several saints [commemorated], but they have only one service. The ecclesiastical rubric does not provide for more than two services to saints [on one day] . 
Now we shall present the order for each of the 20 aforementioned cases.

SAINT WITHOUT POLYELEOS ON WEEKDAYS (EXCEPT SATURDAY)
AT VESPERS

Troparia after “It is truly meet”: of the temple, if it is of the Lord or of the Theotokos, and also of the day of the week, and the other four that are in the Horologion in the order of Small Compline. If the temple is of a saint, then first – of the day, and then – of the temple. On Wednesday and Friday, if the temple is of the Lord or of the Theotokos, there is no need to say that of the temple first, because the Cross Troparion is of the Lord .

If the saint does not have an Exaposteilarion, then Glory, Both now: Theotokion of the Exaposteilarion of the Octoechos. Only on Wednesday and Friday, because the Exaposteilarion of the saint does not have a Stavrotheotokion, but only a Theotokion, the Stavrotheotokion of the Exaposteilarion of the Octoechos is taken. Also on Thursday, for then the Theotokion of the Octoechos is special, relating to St. Nicholas, whose service is leading on this day, the Theotokion of the Octoechos is taken, and not of the Menaion .

5.	At the end: Troparion of the saint, Glory, Both now: Dismissal Theotokion in the tone of the saint’s troparion and of the day of the week, different from the one that was at Vespers and at “God is the Lord”.
o	If two saints occur, then there will be the troparion of the first, Glory: of the second, Both now: Theotokion in the tone of the second and of the day of the week .
Note about a Saint on 6
1.	Sometimes a saint on 6 has nothing more than a saint on 4, except for six troparia in the odes of the Canon of Matins and six stichera on “Lord, I have cried”, if it does not coincide with the service of some feast; for then there will be on “Lord, I have cried” 3 stichera to the feast and 3 to the saint (September 9).
2.	Sometimes he has also on the Aposticha of Matins, after the stichera of the Octoechos, one sticheron with its own refrain, and in addition to that a Doxastikon (November 17).
3.	Sometimes he has Praises stichera, numbering 4, and afterwards – the Small Doxology and the Aposticha of the Octoechos, in its own place (September 6 and October 7). However, in this case, the decision remains with the rector: to take the Great Doxology without the Aposticha, or the Small with the Aposticha .
4.	Sometimes he has not only Praises stichera and the Great Doxology, but also at “Lord, I have cried” the Dogmatikon in the tone of the Doxastikon and a whole proper Aposticha, and for the troparia – the Sunday Theotokion at Vespers and at Matins. At Matins – proper Sessional Hymns and at the Canon – the designated Katavasia after every Ode (October 23 and July 25). If there be a feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos on 6, then the Canon is only of this service, without the Octoechos (July 2 and August 16 and 31).
AT THE HOURS
Troparia and Kontakia: at the 1st – of the day of the week, at the 3rd and 9th – of the saint, at the 6th – of the temple .
•	If two saints occur, then the troparion and Kontakion at the 1st should be of the day of the week, at the 3rd – to the first saint, at the 6th – to the temple, at the 9th – to the second saint .
AT THE LITURGY
According to our general custom everything is taken only of the day, that is:
1.	Troparion of the day of the week, also Glory: its Kontakion, Both now: Kontakion of the temple, if of the Lord or of the Theotokos. If the temple is of a saint – then the general Theotokion “O Protection” (“O Undisputed Intercessor”) , or one of the feasts of the Theotokos, of the tone . On Wednesday and Friday we do not select Theotokia, but replace the Troparion of the day with the Kontakion of the day with the refrain “Glory, Both now”, because this Kontakion is of the Lord.
2.	Prokeimenon, Alleluia, Communion Hymn – of the day (at the end of the Apostle or our Service Book).
3.	Apostle and Gospel – of the day of the week, sequential after the Descent of the Holy Spirit .
Notes
1.	If the service is taken only to the saint, then the Theotokion or Kontakion of the temple is taken one of the aforementioned.
2.	If the service is only for some specific need, then the Theotokion will be for the need, and where there is none, then the Troparion of the service for need is replaced by its Kontakion (with the refrain “Glory, Both now”); it does not have to be of the Lord.
3.	If the service is taken both of the day and to the saint, then the service of the day precedes the saint and there will be the troparion of the day, then – of the saint and Kontakion of the day, also Glory: Kontakion of the saint, Both now: Theotokion or Kontakion of the temple, one of the aforementioned. On Wednesday and Friday: the Kontakion of the saint is replaced by the Kontakion of the day.
4.	If the service of the day or of the saint and for a need is taken, then the service of the day or of the saint precedes the service for need and there will be the troparion of the day or of the saint and for need, also Kontakion of the day or of the saint, Glory: Kontakion for need, Both now: Theotokion for need, if there be one. On Wednesday and Friday: the Kontakion for need is replaced by the Kontakion of the day; but when the need does not have a Theotokion, then there will be Glory: Kontakion of the day, Both now: Kontakion for need.
5.	The service for need, according to the decree of the Lviv Synod , must always be taken alone, except for the Apostle and Gospel of the day, which may be combined with the service for the dead and precede its Apostle and Gospel.
6.	In cathedral churches, where the Divine Service is celebrated properly and daily, one should not leave out the Apostle and Gospel of the day and here it is better to read the Apostle-Gospel of the day, rather than of the saint, for the Apostle-Gospels of the saints are repeated more often during the year, but of the day – not .
7.	If there be several Prokeimena, Alleluias, Apostle-Gospels and Communion Hymns, then one must know how to take them. Know first, that in church typikons more than two are not given, with the exception of Apostle-Gospels, of which only in Slavonic typikons three are given, for the Slavs are richer in supplications than the Greeks. For where three readings coincide, the Greek typikons do not give the sequential one, but the Slavonic ones take it under the refrain of the first reading, as if one with it . When this is impossible, on the occasion of some great feast, then they order to take it on the day before under the refrain with the sequential one . However, this rule has been preserved among us perhaps only in cathedral churches, for in others usually only one Apostle-Gospel is taken, as also one service either of the day, or of the saint, or one for need. If, therefore, there be two Prokeimena and two Alleluias, then both are taken under one heading, that is both Prokeimena – before the refrain of the first reading, both Alleluias – after the completion of the second reading. However, the first Prokeimenon is taken twice, namely: once – before and once – after the verse, the second – only once and without a verse, for in this case the Typikon does not give a verse. Similarly also “Alleluia”: both of its verses are taken only of the first service, and of the second – only one first verse . The Heading, that is from whom: from Paul, from Matthew or from another, is taken only of the first reading, and the others usually are not taken, although it would be better to announce the headings of other readings as well, for it is not indifferent to the listeners to know the reading of which holy author is being proclaimed; and for this reason only would the rubric make certain sense, which orders to take the sequential reading under the refrain, for taking one reading under the refrain of another means merging it with the previous one because its heading is not announced. If the heading of the following third reading, which is not taken under the refrain, is not named, then it should have been said that this third reading is also taken under the refrain. “Let us be attentive” is announced only at the beginning of the first reading. If there be two Communion Hymns, then “Alleluia” is repeated only upon the completion of the second .

 
SAINT WITHOUT POLYELEOS ON A SATURDAY
Note
In the first five days of the week the service of the Octoechos precedes the service of the Menaion; on Saturday – conversely, the service of the Menaion precedes the service of the Octoechos, for on Saturday it is general to all saints and the departed. The service of the Menaion is specific to the saint whose day it is.
AT VESPERS
1.	Kathisma current (18th), which is not taken only when it precedes an All-Night Vigil.
2.	On “Lord, I have cried” – 6 stichera: to the saint of the Menaion – 3 and of the Octoechos – 3, given in the first place , Glory, Both now: 1st Theotokion of the current tone, which is being taken leave of (Dogmatikon of the past Sunday) . After the Doxastikon, if there be one in the Menaion to the saint, the same 1st Theotokion of the tone is taken with the refrain “Both now”.
o	If two saints occur, then there will be to the first saint – 3 and to the second – 3, Glory, Both now: 1st Theotokion of the tone. If there be a Doxastikon to the first saint, then after it is taken that same 1st Theotokion with the refrain “Both now”.
o	If a saint on 6 occurs, then only all 6 stichera are taken to him and the Doxastikon, Both now: 1st Theotokion of the current tone.
3.	Prokeimenon of the day from the Horologion.
4.	On the Aposticha – 3 Martyria stichera of the Octoechos with two usual refrains of the Horologion. However, because between the stichera given on the Aposticha the 2nd and 3rd (in Tone 4 and 6 – only the 3rd) are for the dead, which today we limit to Souls Saturdays, here the stichera for the dead are not taken, but instead of them, the Martyria stichera are taken from the last ones, which are on “Lord, I have cried” . If there be a Doxastikon in the Menaion to the saint, then the Theotokion is taken from the Vespers Aposticha of the Octoechos, in its tone and of the day of the week.
5.	At the end: Troparion of the saint, Glory, Both now: Theotokion from the Sunday ones, in the tone of the saint’s troparion .

FEAST OF THE THEOTOKOS ON WEEKDAYS
Everything – according to the Typikon of a Feast of the Lord (see page 87-89), except for the Antiphons, which will be daily, and the Entrance, which will be “Come, let us worship”, and the Trisagion, which always is on Theotokion feasts.
 
Note about the Afterfeast
Everything is performed according to the Typikon of the Forefeast, given here before on page 81-83. However, in the Afterfeast there will be:
1.	Troparion and Kontakion of the feast itself.
2.	At the Dismissal is commemorated also the service of the feast.
3.	At the Liturgy, in the Afterfeast of the Lord, first two antiphons – of the feast , third – usual with the refrain of the feast, also and the usual Entrance “Come, let us worship” with the same refrain of the feast .
4.	Prokeimenon, Alleluia and Communion Hymn on Sunday – of the day (that is of the Sunday) and of the feast, on weekdays – only of the feast; Apostle and Gospel – of the day . When on Sunday the service of a saint is also taken, then the Prokeimenon, Alleluia and Communion Hymn of the feast are discarded, and only of the Sunday and of the saint are taken. On weekdays, if the service of a saint is combined with the festal service, then all this is taken in the first place – to the saint, afterwards – to the saint. But because among us to a saint without Polyeleos at the Liturgy usually nothing is taken, all this is taken only to the feast.
5.	Instead of “It is truly meet” – Irmos of the 9th Ode of the canon of the feast. However, we will present separate and full models.
