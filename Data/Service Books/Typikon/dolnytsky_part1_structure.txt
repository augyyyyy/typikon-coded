VESPERS
ORDER OF GREAT VESPERS WITH ALL-NIGHT VIGIL
1. Vesting of Sacred Robes and Censing
“After the candles on the main Holy Table are lit and two censers prepared, if two deacons are to serve (if not, then one), the priest, having blessed the epitrachelion with his hand arranged as for the blessing at Liturgy and having kissed the cross upon it, puts it on himself . The deacons take upon themselves the dalmatic with the orarion, having kissed it beforehand. All three come out, one after another, first the second deacon, after him the first, and last the priest, from the sacristy to the front of the steps of the Holy Table; having taken their stand: the first deacon on the left, and the second on the right of the priest, with the priest between them, all three bow low to the Holy Mysteries and, having turned all together to the Holy Doors (the priest and second deacon to the right, and the first deacon to the left), they open them and, having turned toward the Holy Table, likewise by a half-turn, the deacons take the censers, and the priest, with his right hand, takes the spoon and puts incense first into the censer of the first, and then into the censer of the second deacon. And after the deacons say: ‘Bless, Master, the censer,’ the priest blesses both censers in the form of a cross, each separately, and they all recite together the prayer ‘Incense we offer to Thee,’ which is given in the Service Book at the end of the Proskomedia. At other censings, instead of this prayer, only [the following] is said: ‘Blessed is our God always, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.’ In churches that are merely Cathedral Eparchial or Monastic, the second deacon exclaims to the priest who stands at that same place: ‘Command!’ . At this time, all rise; the deacons cense, always with three swings of the censer, first the Holy Table from the four sides, namely first from the front both together, bowing low to the Holy Mysteries while doing so; then the first deacon goes to the right side, and the second to the left, each censing his own side of the Holy Table, and also from behind (and, if it exists, the icon behind the Holy Table) both together, and [they cense] the priest from the front corners of the Holy Table both together, and come out, each through his own door, to the front of the Holy Doors and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, they turn to the local icons of the iconostasis, each censing the icon on his own side. Also, they go around the temple with smoking censers, each on his own side, censing while doing so the icons of the side altars, if such exist. After this, having returned from the great church doors through the middle of the temple to the front of the Holy Doors and having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, they turn — the deacon who is on the right to the left, and the deacon who is on the left to the right — toward the west, and each censes the krylos on his own side (if the church is a cathedral, also the choirs) and, at the end, both together [cense] the people.”
“Let it be known to all:
1.	If the Bishop is also present, then in this case, it is proper for the deacons to approach his throne and cense him both together, and after this, having withdrawn to the middle, to cense the kryloi, etc.
2.	It is proper for the deacons and the priest, upon the conclusion of the censing of each icon, the Bishop, the krylos, the choir, and the people, to bow to them, but while censing the Holy Table, to bow only from the front.”
“After censing the people, the deacons turn to the Holy Doors and the first exclaims: ‘Lord, bless’ . After this, both deacons, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, return, each through his own door, to the sanctuary. If there is only one deacon, he alone censes around the Holy Table and, having exited through the northern door, censes the icons of the local tier on the right side, likewise on the left; having gone around the temple from the right side to the left and having bowed from the Holy Doors to the Holy Mysteries, he censes everything else according to the rubric, and returns to the sanctuary through the southern door. If there is no deacon at all, then the priest censes alone and exclaims: ‘Lord, bless.’ Having censed the Holy Table, he exits the sanctuary into the temple through the Holy Doors and, after censing the iconostasis, goes around the temple as prescribed when one deacon serves; upon the conclusion of the censing, he exclaims before the Holy Doors ‘Lord, bless’ and returns to the sanctuary through the Holy, that is, the central, doors of the iconostasis” .
2. From “Glory to the Holy” to the Entrance
“When the deacons, having put away the censers, take their stand, each on his own side, near the priest in front of the steps, the priest sings in a loud voice: ‘Glory to the Holy, Consubstantial, Life-Creating and Undivided Trinity, always, now and ever, and unto ages of ages’ . After ‘Amen,’ the choir [sings] immediately: ‘Come, let us worship’ three times, and all three sacred ministers close the Holy Doors, and the candles on the Holy Table are extinguished.
During the singing of the Prefatory Psalm (103rd), lit candles are handed to the deacons, and each of them exits through his own door to the front of the Holy Doors, and behind them the priest also, having exited through the northern door, stands between them before the Holy Doors and, having bowed together with the deacons to the Holy Mysteries, reads quietly the Prayers of Vespers, and the deacons provide light for him.
“After the Prefatory Psalm and ‘Alleluia,’ the first deacon sings the litany ‘In peace let us pray to the Lord.’ The priest continues to read the Prayers of Vespers at that same place, and at the end of the litany exclaims: ‘For to Thee belongs.’ Afterward, all three, having bowed together, exit the sanctuary: the first deacon, and after him the priest, through the southern door, and the second through the northern, and they sit there behind the Holy Table: the priest in the middle, the first deacon to the right, and the second to the left of him. After the first Kathisma, that is, after ‘Blessed is the man,’ the second deacon, having come out to the front of the Holy Doors, sings the Small Litany, and the priest, having risen, exclaims from his place: ‘For Thine is the dominion.’ If there is no deacon, then this litany, according to local custom, is said by the priest quietly, and the choir responds to its petitions aloud.
After the litany, ‘Lord, I have cried’ is sung according to the tone of the first stichera. During the singing, the deacons turn to the priest: ‘Bless, Master, the censer,’ and the priest blesses the censer with the words: ‘Blessed is our God’ , after which the deacons cense the Holy Table from the four sides, the iconostasis, the clergy, the choirs, and the people and, having bowed before the Holy Doors, return behind the Holy Table to the priest.”
3. Entrance and Censing at “Gladsome Light”
“When the choir begins to sing the last verse of the psalm, that is, ‘For His mercy is great toward us,’ the priest vests in the phelonion, having blessed it and having kissed the cross upon it, and at ‘Glory’ makes the Entrance with the censer together with the deacons in the following manner: Having come to the front of the steps of the Holy Table and having bowed all together to the Holy Mysteries, they open the Holy Doors (which remain open until the beginning of Matins) and, having turned again to the Holy Table, the deacons take the censers and, having received the blessing of the censer from the priest as presented at ‘Lord, I have cried,’ all three go around the Holy Table from its right side in this manner: first goes the second deacon, after him the first, and at the end the priest and, preceded by two candle-bearers, they exit through the northern door and stand before the Holy Doors, that is, the second deacon stands on the left side, near the icon of the Theotokos, facing south, the first on the right side near the icon of the Savior, slightly lower, and the priest directly before the Holy Doors; and immediately the first deacon, standing at the right hand of the priest, slightly at a distance from him, having bowed a little and holding the orarion with the first three fingers of his right hand, says quietly to the priest: ‘Let us pray to the Lord.’ The priest, having bowed in the same way, says the Prayer of the Entrance. After the prayer, the priest and deacon straighten up, and the deacon, holding the orarion with three fingers of his right hand in the direction of the east, says to the priest: ‘Bless, Master, the holy entrance.’ The priest blesses toward the east, saying: ‘Blessed is the entrance of Thy holy ones always, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.’
If a Bishop is present in the church, the deacons go to him and cense him, and the first deacon, having bowed his head before him, asks of him the blessing for the Entrance: ‘Bless, Master, the entrance of Thy holy ones,’ etc.; the priest, in this case, does nothing.
When the priest blesses the Entrance, both deacons stand before him in one row (longitudinal), that is, the first deacon stands before the priest with his back to him, and the second before the first in the same way. At the conclusion of the stichera, the first deacon makes the sign of the cross with the censer and exclaims: ‘Wisdom! Upright!’ and, during the singing of ‘Gladsome Light,’ the deacons enter the sanctuary and cense the Holy Table from the four sides and everything else as at ‘Lord, I have cried’ .
After the deacons, the priest also enters the sanctuary and waits before the steps until the deacons, having returned to the sanctuary after the censing and having bowed to the Holy Mysteries, stand together with him before the steps of the Holy Table.”
4. Prokeimenon and Readings
“After the singing of ‘Gladsome Light,’ the deacons approach the Holy Doors and the first of them, looking at the people, exclaims: ‘Let us be attentive’; the priest, also having turned his right side to the people, blesses them in the form of a cross with his right hand, arranged as for the blessing at Liturgy, singing: ‘Peace be unto all,’ and then, the second deacon also exclaims to the people: ‘Wisdom! Let us be attentive!’. During the singing of the Prokeimenon with its verses, all three turn to the Holy Table, and the priest, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, goes to the right behind the Holy Table and sits there during the readings.
The deacons remain near the Holy Doors and, before the title of each reading, the first of them exclaims to the people: ‘Wisdom!’, and after the title — the second, likewise to the people: ‘Let us be attentive!’. If there are no deacons, the priest exclaims all this from his place.”
5. From “Let us say all” to the Litiya
“Upon the conclusion of the readings, the priest comes to the front of the steps and, together with the deacons, bows to the Holy Mysteries. After this, the priest approaches the Holy Table, while the deacons withdraw to the front of the iconostasis, and the first of them sings the litany ‘Let us say all,’ and the second, after ‘Vouchsafe, O Lord,’ [sings] the litany ‘Let us complete.’ The exclamations for the litanies are sung by the priest, and after the first exclamation of the litany ‘Let us complete,’ while singing ‘Peace be unto all,’ he blesses the people with his right hand as before the Prokeimenon. During the prayer at the bowing of heads, the sacred ministers and all the people bow their heads” .
6. Litiya
“After the exclamation ‘Blessed be the might of Thy kingdom,’ when candles are lit throughout the whole church and distributed to the church brotherhood and other people, both choirs gather in the middle of the church and begin to sing the Litiya stichera. The deacons, having bowed before the Holy Doors, enter, each through his own door, into the sanctuary and, having stood before the steps of the Holy Table and having bowed low before it, receive the censers, and one of them (the one on the left) also the vigil vessel (litiinyk) with the loaves which are to be blessed. The priest, holding a cross in his right hand, approaches the front of the steps of the Holy Table and, having bowed together with the deacons before the Holy Table, they all exit together from the sanctuary: the priest through the central [doors], and the deacons through the side doors.
Having approached the tetrapod, the deacon places upon it the vigil vessel with the loaves, and then, all of them, preceded by the choir and a candle-bearer, proceed to the narthex, or, if there is none, to a place near the doors of the church and take their stand there facing the Holy Table: the choirs on the sides, and the sacred ministers in one transverse row, that is, the priest between the deacons. The deacons, having received the blessing of the censer from the priest as at ‘Lord, I have cried,’ both together cense the priest, then each his own choir and, at the end, both together [cense] the people, each in front of himself .
Upon the conclusion of the Litiya stichera, the deacons, beginning with the first, sing alternately the litany ‘O God, save Thy people,’ after which the priest exclaims: ‘Hear us, O God’ and, singing ‘Peace be unto all,’ blesses with his right hand in the form of a cross. During the concluding prayer ‘O Master, Plenteous in Mercy,’ which the priest sings, all stand with bowed heads.”
7. From the Aposticha to the Blessing of Loaves
“After the prayer, the choirs sing ‘Amen’ and return to the church together with the sacred ministers, where, having taken their stand behind them, they begin to sing the Aposticha, while the sacred ministers, first the deacons and after them the priest, having entered the temple, stand in one row before the tetrapod. After the singing of the Aposticha and ‘Lord, now lettest Thou,’ the choirs recite the Trisagion with ‘Our Father,’ and the priest exclaims: ‘For Thine is the kingdom,’ and when the choirs begin to sing the troparia, he takes the censer and, as soon as the first deacon says: ‘Bless, Master, the censer,’ he puts in incense, blesses it and, having said: ‘Blessed is our God,’ censes from four sides the loaves placed on the tetrapod: first from the front, then from the southern side, from the eastern and, at the end, from the northern. Before and after the censing, it is proper for the priest to bow low to the Holy Mysteries from the east, and after the bow to turn his left side to the tetrapod. After the censing, it is proper for him to turn his right side to the Holy Mysteries and, after the bow, to withdraw to the northern side of the tetrapod.
The Troparia are taken in the following manner: If it is a Feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos — the troparion of the Feast three times, without ‘Glory, Both now.’ If it is a feast of a Saint with a Vigil on a Sunday, then the troparion ‘Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos’ twice and the troparion of the Saint once, without ‘Glory, Both now.’ If it is a feast of a Saint on a weekday, then the troparion of the Saint twice and ‘Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos’ once, without ‘Glory, Both now.’ (Formerly the Vigil was celebrated every Sunday, and then the troparion ‘Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos’ was sung three times).”
8. Blessing of Loaves
“After the singing of the last troparion, the blessing of loaves takes place in the following manner: Five prosphora are placed from above onto the vigil vessel, that is, four crosswise together, and the fifth above them. At the bottom of the vigil vessel is wheat; on the left side, that is, from the icon of the Theotokos — a vessel with wine; on the left — with oil. After the first deacon exclaims: ‘Let us pray to the Lord,’ the priest lifts the upper prosphora with his right hand and begins to sing the prayer of blessing ‘O Lord Jesus Christ’; when he exclaims: ‘Thyself bless now, O Master,’ he places the upper prosphora on the other four and sings further: ‘Bless these loaves †, the wheat †, the wine †, and the oil †,’ and, naming each of the four, blesses it.”
9. Conclusion of Vespers
“Upon the conclusion of the prayer, when the choirs respond ‘Amen’ and read the psalm ‘Blessed be the name of the Lord,’ one of the deacons takes the vigil vessel with the blessed loaves; at this time the choirs withdraw to their places, and all three sacred ministers enter the sanctuary: the priest through the central [doors], the deacons through the side doors. The deacons put away the candles and the vigil vessel, after which all three stand before the steps of the Holy Table and immediately after the words of the psalm ‘Rich men have turned poor,’ the priest, having turned right toward the people, blesses them in the form of a cross, simultaneously singing: ‘The blessing of the Lord be upon you’ and, having turned left toward the Holy Table, begins Matins from ‘Glory to the Holy’.”
Note on standing and sitting during Vespers
“Our simple people have a praiseworthy custom to always stand during the Divine Services; let all others stand at this Vespers:
1.	During the censing.
2.	From the beginning until the Prefatory Psalm (103rd).
3.	During the singing of the first 2 verses of the psalm ‘Lord, I have cried.’
4.	From ‘Glory, Both now’ of the stichera at ‘Lord, I have cried’ until the end of the Prokeimenon.
5.	At ‘Vouchsafe, O Lord.’
6.	At the Litiya prayer ‘O Master, Plenteous in Mercy,’ moreover, at it we bow our heads, just as at the silent prayer of the litany ‘Let us complete.’
7.	From ‘Lord, now lettest Thou’ until the end of Vespers.”

 
ORDER OF GREAT VESPERS WITHOUT VIGIL
Beginning
“The priest takes the epitrachelion, blesses it and, having kissed the cross upon it which is at the top, puts it on himself and exits through the northern door to the front of the closed Holy Doors. Here, having bowed low, he begins as usual: ‘Blessed is our God,’ etc. The choirs sing ‘Amen,’ and also recite alternately the introductory prayers, that is, ‘Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee,’ ‘O Heavenly King,’ ‘O All-Holy Trinity,’ ‘Lord, have mercy’ (3), ‘Glory, Both now,’ ‘Our Father.’ The priest: ‘For Thine is the kingdom.’ The choirs: ‘Amen,’ also ‘Lord, have mercy’ (12), 6 by each choir, ‘Glory, Both now,’ ‘Come, let us worship’ (3).”
Notes
“1. If there is only one choir, then all the aforementioned is recited alternately by the priest and the choir such that after ‘Amen’ the priest begins: ‘Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.’
2. If there are also deacons, then they too, having exited with the priest from the sanctuary to the front of the Holy Doors, stand there: one on the right, and the second on the left of him, and the one on the right proclaims: ‘Bless, Master’ and the priest begins: ‘Blessed is our God’ .
Main Part
“After this, from the Prefatory Psalm to the exclamation ‘Blessed be the might of Thy kingdom’ of the litany ‘Let us complete,’ all parts are taken and everything is done as at Great Vespers with Vigil, only at this Vespers, at ‘Lord, I have cried’ there can be not only 10 or 8 stichera as at Great [Vespers] with Vigil, but also 6.
After the exclamation of the priest, who remains at the Holy Table (together with the deacons, if there are any) ‘Blessed be the might of Thy kingdom,’ the Aposticha is sung, also ‘Lord, now lettest Thou,’ the Trisagion and everything else with ‘Our Father,’ after which the priest: ‘For Thine is the kingdom.’ The choirs sing the troparia in the following manner:
If the service is Sunday, they sing the Sunday troparion of the current tone, also Glory: the troparion of the current Saint (of the Menaion) and at the end Both now: the Theotokion, one of the Sunday ones, according to the tone of the troparion of the current Saint. If there is no Sunday service, but there is a service of a Polyeleos Saint, then the troparion of the Saint is taken, Glory, Both now: the Theotokion, from the Sunday ones, according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint. In the middle of a Feast (of the Lord or of the Theotokos) Theotokia are not taken, but after the troparion of the Saint, the troparion of the Feast is taken.”
Conclusion
“Priest: ‘Wisdom!’
Choir: ‘Bless.’
Priest: ‘Blessed is He Who Is, and is pre-glorified, Christ our God, always, now and ever, and unto ages of ages’ .
Choir: ‘Amen,’ and immediately: ‘Confirm, O God, the Catholic faith unto ages of ages.’
Priest: ‘O Most Holy Theotokos, save us.’
Choir: ‘More honorable.’
Priest, bowing low to the Holy Mysteries: ‘Glory to Thee, O Christ God, our hope, glory to Thee.’
Choir: ‘Glory, Both now,’ ‘Lord, have mercy’ (3), ‘Lord, bless’ .
The priest departs from the Holy Table and, standing in the Holy Doors facing the people, pronounces the dismissal, mentioning in it the current service (that is, the one which falls on that day, one or more, as many as there are).”
Notes
1.	“If there are deacons, then at the end of the troparia they exit, each through his own door, to the front of the Holy Doors and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, take their stand: one on the right, and the second on the left of the Holy Doors, facing one another; then the first deacon, who is near the icon of the Savior, lifts the orarion with three fingers of his right hand toward the people and exclaims: ‘Wisdom!’; the second, who is near the icon of the Theotokos: ‘Bless.’ Priest: ‘Blessed is He Who Is,’ etc., and remains there until the end of the dismissal. When the priest pronounces the dismissal, both deacons hold their oraria raised with three fingers of the right hand, and at the end, having bowed all together to the Holy Mysteries, they enter, each through his own door, into the sanctuary and, having closed the Holy Doors together with the priest and having bowed all three together to the Holy Mysteries, depart to the sacristy. If there is only one deacon, he alone exits through the southern door to the front of the icon of the Savior and exclaims: ‘Wisdom!’, holding during this and at the dismissal the orarion raised as was noted above.”
2.	“It is not proper to sit at this Vespers either, when it is prescribed not to sit at Vespers with Vigil, up to, and including, the dismissal.”

 
ORDER OF DAILY VESPERS
Rubrics during the entire Vespers
“Let it be known that at this Vespers there is no Entrance, therefore the Holy Doors are not opened, nor do deacons serve, nor does the priest use the phelonion, but only the epitrachelion; he censes only at ‘Lord, I have cried.’ The priest comes out to the front of the Holy Doors in the following cases:
1.	At the beginning as at Great Vespers.
2.	At all litanies (except the one Small Litany, which, according to local custom, he says quietly at his place).
3.	At ‘Wisdom! Upright!’ and remains there until the end of the exclamation ‘Let us be attentive! Peace be unto all!’, during which he gives the peace, having turned to the people.
4.	At the end, at the dismissal.”
Text
“From the beginning of Vespers until the stichera at ‘Lord, I have cried’ everything is similar as at Great Vespers without Vigil; only here, instead of the 1st Kathisma (‘Blessed is the man’), the current Kathisma will be [read]; if on the previous day there was a Vigil, then on account of the vigil labor, the current Kathisma is not taken at such Vespers; and because formerly, according to the Typikon, the Vigil was every Sunday, therefore, according to that same Typikon, at Vespers on Sunday for Monday there is no Kathisma, even though now there is not a Vigil every Sunday. The stichera at ‘Lord, I have cried’ will be not 10 and not 8, but 6, at the end of which there will be no Prayer of the Entrance because there is no Entrance. Upon the conclusion of the stichera: ‘Wisdom! Upright!’, ‘Gladsome Light,’ ‘Let us be attentive! Peace be unto all! Wisdom! Let us be attentive!’ and the Prokeimenon of the day from the Horologion; there will be no readings, nor is there at this place the litany ‘Let us say all,’ but immediately ‘Vouchsafe, O Lord’ and everything else until the end as at Great Vespers without Vigil, only here after the troparion of the Saint, because he is not a Polyeleos one, the Theotokion is not taken from the Sunday ones, but from the Daily Dismissal ones, according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint and according to the day of the week. If two Saints occur, then are taken: the troparion of the first Saint, Glory: the troparion of the second, Both now: the Dismissal Theotokion, according to the tone of the troparion of the second Saint; in the middle of a Feast also at this Vespers we do not conclude with the Dismissal Theotokia, but with the troparion of the Feast. Furthermore, upon the conclusion of the troparia, the priest sings the litany ‘Have mercy on us, O God’ and makes the middle dismissal, that is, he exclaims: ‘Wisdom!’, and the choir immediately: ‘More honorable’ and everything else as at Great Vespers without Vigil. At ‘Christ our True God’ the priest turns to the people.”
Notes
1.	“On Sunday itself or on another Feast with Vigil in parish churches in the province, the general custom remains to make an Entrance.
2.	It is not proper to sit at this Vespers either, when it is not permitted to sit at Great Vespers without Vigil.”
________________________________________
ORDER OF SMALL VESPERS
“This Vespers is celebrated just as Daily [Vespers] , however, without a Kathisma and without litanies, except for the last ‘Have mercy on us, O God,’ which only the Slavonic Typikons present, but the Greek do not prescribe. The stichera at ‘Lord, I have cried’ will be only 4. The dismissal, although it can begin from ‘Glory to Thee, O Christ God,’ yet with us is exclaimed also before that: ‘Wisdom!’ and ‘More honorable’ just as at Daily Vespers.”

 
COMPLINE
ORDER OF SMALL COMPLINE
Text
1.	“The beginning is usual, that is ‘Blessed is our God’ etc., ‘Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee’ and all other introductory prayers up to ‘Come, let us worship’ (3) inclusive, exactly as we presented at Great Vespers without Vigil” .
2.	“The Three Psalms, Small Doxology and Symbol of Faith just as in the Horologion.”
3.	“The Canon to the Theotokos of the Octoechos, according to the tone and day of the week, without Katavasiae and without litanies, has only after the 6th Ode ‘Lord, have mercy’ (3), Glory, Both now: Sessional Hymn, and sometimes also a Kontakion. [For personal use in the Prayer Book one Canon to the Theotokos of the Octoechos is given, of Tuesday Tone 8, and in it, after the 3rd Ode — a Sessional Hymn, and after the 6th — a Kontakion and Ikos].”
4.	“After the Canon — ‘It is truly meet,’ Trisagion and everything else with ‘Our Father’ and ‘For Thine is the kingdom’.”
5.	“Troparia for various occasions, that is:
a) On the first five weekdays, beginning with Monday; b) on Saturday; c) on Sunday; d) for occasions of Feasts and a Polyeleos Saint.”
“On the first five days of the week the following six troparia are taken, that is first of the Temple, if it is of the Lord or of the Theotokos, after this the troparion of the weekday; if the Temple is not of the Lord and not of the Theotokos, but of a Saint, then first the troparion of the day, and after it of the Temple; and the other four troparia which are given in the Horologion, beginning from ‘O God of our Fathers’ with the subsequent three; monks before ‘O God of our Fathers’ recite also the troparion to St. Basil. On Thursday, because the service is double and has two troparia, there will be seven troparia, and in monasteries — eight, with the troparion of St. Basil . On Wednesday and Friday, because the troparion is of the Lord, that is ‘O Lord, save Thy people,’ it in any case takes the first place, after it — the troparion of the Temple.”
“On Saturday, that is on Friday evening for Saturday, the troparia are three: first of the day, and then Glory: Kontakion to the Dead, Both now: Kontakion of the day. Because on Saturday the temple service has greater significance than on other days of the week, which follows from the fact that it has a Canon at Matins, therefore for the sake of this the troparion of the day is preceded by the troparion of the Temple, if it is of the Lord or of the Theotokos, but not in the case where the temple is of a Saint, because his memory is already mentioned in the troparion of the day which is dedicated to all Saints.”
“On Sunday, that is from Saturday evening for Sunday, our Horologia present only the Hypakoe of the tone of the Sunday.”
“In the case of a festal service (Forefeast and Afterfeast of the Lord or of the Theotokos), and also in the case of a Polyeleos Saint, only the Kontakion of the named service is said.”
1.	“After the troparia — ‘Lord, have mercy’ (40) and everything else, as given in the Horologion.”
2.	“At the end — the dismissal, and after it — the litany, as in the Horologion at the end of Daily Midnight Office (the petitions given before the litany are recited only in monasteries). Instead of this litany, we say today in private ‘Remit, pardon’.”
Rubrics
“This Compline, if it is celebrated in church, is celebrated only in the epitrachelion, with closed Holy Doors. The priest comes out to the front of the Holy Doors at the beginning and remains there until ‘Come, let us worship,’ and again comes out at ‘Thou Who at all times’ and remains there until the end.”
“At the dismissal of this Compline, as at the dismissal of every other Divine Service, if it is celebrated in church, it is proper for the priest to turn to the people.” 
ORDER OF GREAT COMPLINE WITHOUT VIGIL
“The Order of this Compline is given in the Horologion or in the Prayer Book. And the rubrics for the priest at it are such:
a) He uses only the epitrachelion, first having blessed and having kissed the cross upon it.
b) He stands before the Holy Doors: from the usual beginning to ‘Come, let us worship’ (3) inclusive; at all prayers, that is at the prayer of St. Basil ‘O Lord, Lord’; at the prayer of Manasses ‘O Lord Almighty,’ at [the prayer] of Basil ‘O Master God’; and from ‘Thou Who at all times’ to the end of Compline, inclusive of the Litanies. At the verses of the Song of Isaiah ‘God is with us’ and at the moleben verses ‘O All-Holy Lady’ he does not have to come out to the front of the Holy Doors, nor recite them alternately with the choir, if there are two choirs, but only when there is only one choir.
c) At the prayer ‘O Master, Plenteous in Mercy’ (instead of the dismissal) he does not turn to the people.
d) This Compline, just as the Small, is celebrated with closed Holy Doors.”
Note
This Compline we celebrate on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (and only according to the rubric of the Slavonic Triodia, also on Friday) in all weeks of the Great Forty Days, on Tuesday and Thursday of Cheese-fare Week, which precedes the Forty Days, on Monday and Tuesday of Passion Week, which follows the Forty Days.
ORDER OF GREAT COMPLINE WITH ALL-NIGHT VIGIL
“From the beginning of Compline to the end of the Doxology (‘Glory to God in the highest’) everything is taken exactly as at Great Compline without Vigil , and after the Doxology immediately the Litiya and everything else according to the order as at Vespers with Vigil. However, after the Trisagion, instead of the troparia of the day given after the Trisagion, which is after ‘O All-Holy Lady,’ the troparion of the Feast is taken once, and instead of the troparia ‘Have mercy on us, O Lord,’ given after the Prayer of Manasses, the Kontakion of the Feast is taken once. At the beginning of Compline the Holy Doors are opened and the priest censes only in the epitrachelion, and the deacons, if there are any, in deacon’s sticharia (dalmatics) — all according to the order as at the beginning of Vespers with Vigil; immediately after the usual beginning (‘Blessed is our God’) the Holy Doors are closed, and are opened at the beginning of the Litiya and remain open until the beginning of Matins just as at Vespers with Vigil.” 
MIDNIGHT OFFICE
“The Midnight Office has three forms: Daily, Saturday and Sunday. The Daily and Saturday have one form, although different prayers, and their order is placed in the Horo- and Prayer Book. The Order of the Sunday [Midnight Office] is also given in the Horologion and Prayer Book; however, the Triadic Canon must be taken from the Octoechos of the current tone because the Canon placed in the Horo- and Prayer Book, of which each of the eight odes is taken from one of the eight tones of the Octoechos, is said only in private.
According to the Typikon the time of the Midnight Office is midnight itself; but according to our current custom we celebrate it in the evening before, or in the morning after midnight.”
Note
On the Troparion and Kontakion of the Feast at Midnight Office
There occur some cases of feasts in which at the Midnight Office, instead of the three usual troparia ‘Behold, the Bridegroom’ and the two others which follow the first Trisagion, the troparion of the Feast is taken, and instead of the four troparia ‘Remember’ and the three others which follow the second Trisagion with the prayer ‘Remember, O Lord,’ the Kontakion of the Feast is taken, leaving out ‘Lord, have mercy’ (12) given before the prayer ‘Remember.’ These cases are the following:
In the Menaion period:
January 26 — Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos
January 1 — (if there is no Vigil)
January 7 — Synaxis of the Forerunner
February 2 — Meeting [of the Lord] (if there is no Vigil)
In the Triodion period:
Lazarus Saturday
Leavetaking of the Resurrection
Monday of Pentecost, that is on Sunday for Monday .
 
ORDER OF GREAT MATINS
with Vigil and without Vigil
From the beginning to the troparia at “God is the Lord”
“If there is a Vigil, then we begin Great Matins immediately after Great Vespers in the following manner: the priest, having on himself the epitrachelion and phelonion and having finished Vespers with the words: ‘The blessing of the Lord be upon you,’ turns to the Holy Table and, standing before its steps, exclaims: ‘Glory to the Holy.’ Choir: ‘Amen’ and ‘Glory to God in the highest’ (3) with small bows, and ‘O Lord, open Thou my lips’ (2) without bows, and also the Six Psalms. The priest, after ‘O Lord, open Thou my lips,’ having closed the Holy Doors and having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, removes the phelonion, exits through the northern door to the front of the Holy Doors and, again having bowed low, recites there the Morning Prayers .
If there is no Vigil, then Matins is sung in the morning, separately from Vespers, in the following manner: the priest, having taken the epitrachelion, having blessed and having kissed it at the top where it has a cross, exits through the northern door to the front of the closed Holy Doors and exclaims, bowing low: ‘Blessed is our God.’ Choir: ‘Amen,’ and also ‘Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee,’ ‘O Heavenly King,’ Trisagion with ‘Our Father.’ Priest: ‘For Thine is the kingdom.’ Choir: ‘Amen,’ ‘Lord, have mercy’ (12), ‘Come, let us worship’ (3). The priest, having bowed low, enters through the southern door into the sanctuary and, having stood and having bowed low before the steps of the Holy Table, and having received the censer, and having put in incense, and having blessed it with a short prayer, censes around the Holy Table; after this, having exited through the northern door and having bowed low, he censes the iconostasis, choirs and people, according to custom. The choirs recite the Two Psalms. Upon the conclusion of the Trisagion with ‘Our Father’ the priest returns and, standing before the Holy Doors, and bowing low, and censing toward the Holy Table, exclaims: ‘For Thine is the kingdom’; then, having entered through the southern door into the sanctuary and having put away the censer, he exits through the northern door to the front of the iconostasis and, having bowed low, upon the conclusion of the troparia, recites the litany for the Tsar and after its exclamation:
‘Glory to the Holy,’ etc., as at Matins with Vigil, reciting also the other prayers before the Holy Doors.
“After the Six Psalms the priest sings the litany ‘In peace let us pray to the Lord’ and, when the choirs sing ‘God is the Lord’ according to the tone of the troparion of that day, he sings the verses at ‘God is the Lord’; then, having bowed, he withdraws through the southern door to his place in the sanctuary. After this, the troparia are sung in the following manner: 
Troparia at “God is the Lord”
“If it is a Feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos, then the troparion of the Feast twice, and also Glory, Both now: once more the same one.
If the service is Sunday and of a Saint with his own troparion, then the Sunday troparion of the current tone twice, Glory: troparion of the Saint once, and Both now: Theotokion from the Sunday ones, according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint.
If the service is Sunday and of two Saints with their own troparia, then the Sunday troparion of the current tone once, troparion of the first Saint once, Glory: troparion of the second Saint once, Both now: Theotokion from the Sunday ones, according to the tone of the Doxastikon, that is of the second Saint .
If the service is Sunday and of a Feast, and of a Saint, then the troparion of the current tone twice, Glory: troparion of the Saint once, Both now: troparion of the service of the Feast once .
If the service is of a Saint on a weekday, then the troparion of the Saint twice, and also Glory, Both now: Theotokion, according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint, or from the Sunday ones if the Saint is a Polyeleos one, or a Dismissal one if [he is] non-Polyeleos, but then the Theotokion will be according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint and according to the day of the week.
If two non-Polyeleos Saints, then the troparion of the first Saint twice, Glory: of the second once, Both now: Dismissal Theotokion, according to the tone of the second Saint and according to the day of the week.
If on a weekday the service is of a Feast and of a Saint, then the troparion of the service of the Feast twice, Glory: troparion of the Saint once, Both now: once more the troparion of the Feast^[3].
If on a weekday the service is of a Feast and of two Saints with their own troparia, then the troparion of the service of the Feast once, troparion of the first Saint once, Glory: of the second Saint once, and also Both now: troparion of the service of the Feast once” .
From the Troparia to the Gradual
“After the troparia the reader reads the current Kathisma, given according to the content in the Psalter (according to the current local custom, only a few verses). Then follows the Small Litany with the exclamation ‘For Thine is the dominion,’ which according to local custom the priest says quietly, sitting at his place, while the choir sings its responses aloud; then follows the Sessional Hymn and Glory, Both now: its Theotokion.
After this — one more current Kathisma, on account of Sunday, either the 17th, which is called ‘The Blameless,’ or the 19th, which is called ‘Polyeleos’ (‘Plenteous in Mercy’), after which go the troparia ‘The Angelic Council’ and the Small Litany with the exclamation ‘For blessed is’ and the Hypakoe of the current tone; on the occasion of a Feast the 19th Kathisma (Polyeleos) is always taken, after which go the ‘Magnification’ and the Small Litany with the exclamation ‘For holy art Thou’ and the Polyeleos Sessional Hymn . When the service is Sunday and the service of some Polyeleos Saint, then only the 19th Kathisma is taken and immediately the ‘Magnification,’ and also ‘The Angelic Council’ and the Small Litany with the exclamation ‘For blessed is,’ the Hypakoe of the tone, then all three Sessional Hymns of the Saint, that is the first and second once each, without Theotokia, Glory: his Polyeleos Sessional Hymn once, and Both now: its Theotokion, because after the first and second Kathismata the Sunday Sessional Hymns were taken, and the Sessional Hymns of the Saint did not have a place there. Regarding the Polyeleos, let it be known that it is sung on all Feasts which have Great Vespers and Great Matins. On the occasion of Sunday it is sung only on the Sundays from the Leavetaking of the Holy Cross to the Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, excluding both, that is from September 22 to December 19, both inclusive; and from the Leavetaking of Theophany (January 14) exclusively to Cheese-fare Sunday, which precedes the Great Forty Days inclusive. On other Sundays of the whole year the 17th Kathisma is used; from the 19th Kathisma, that is the Polyeleos, only the two first psalms (134th and 135th) are prescribed; according to our current custom only selected verses are taken, that is from the first psalm we sing four verses, and from the second — four; from the first verses: 1, 2, 13 and 21; from the second: 1, 6, 12 and 26. And in the middle, and at the end of the verses, ‘Alleluia’ is added, necessary for the perfect development of pleasant singing.”
From the Gradual to the Canon
“After the Hypakoe or after the third Sessional Hymn, if the service is Sunday, the Gradual (Stepenna) of the current tone is sung, all three antiphons (in Tone 8 — four); if the service is a Feast, then only the first antiphon of Tone 4 . The Gradual is given in the Octoechos, in the section of each tone, and also in the Irmologion, set to musical notes.
When the Gradual reaches the end, the priest, having risen, vests in the phelonion, having blessed it before that and having kissed it where it has a cross (if he celebrates Matins separately from Vespers; if together, then it is sufficient for the priest to bless and kiss the phelonion when he vests in it the first time, according to our custom, at the Entrance of Vespers), goes to the front of the steps of the Holy Table and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, turns right to the Holy Doors, opens them and, having turned likewise by a half-turn to the Holy Table, exclaims, upon the conclusion of the Gradual: ‘Let us be attentive. Peace be unto all,’ turning to the people and blessing them, ‘Wisdom, let us be attentive’; and the Prokeimenon is sung twice. During the singing of the Prokeimenon, the priest, having put incense into the censer and having blessed it with the prayer ‘Incense we offer to Thee,’ exclaims: ‘For holy art Thou, O our God’ etc. and ‘Let everything that hath breath’ is sung three times; the priest, having received the censer, censes the Holy Table from four sides and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries and having turned right, exits through the central doors to the front of the iconostasis, censes the local icons, choirs and people, according to custom, and, having put away the censer, exclaims: ‘And that we may be vouchsafed,’ approaches the Holy Table, opens the Gospel and, holding it, proceeds between two candle-bearers to the Holy Doors and exclaims from the Holy Doors facing the people: ‘Peace be unto all,’ blessing the people with his right hand in the form of a cross: ‘Wisdom, Upright’ etc. At ‘Glory to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee’ he makes the sign of the cross on himself, having bowed his head slightly, and sings: ‘Let us be attentive. At that time’ or ‘The Lord said’ etc. Upon the conclusion of the Gospel, having kissed it there where the reading began, and, at ‘Glory to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee’ having crossed himself, having bowed his head, he closes the Gospel and, having taken it with both hands, preceded by candle-bearers, carries it out to the tetrapod from its left side, that is from the icon of the Theotokos and, having placed it in the middle of the tetrapod, withdraws from its right side, from the icon of the Savior, through the Holy Doors to the sanctuary; the people approach to kiss the Gospel and, upon the reading of ‘The Resurrection of Christ’ and the 50th Psalm, and upon the singing of the two troparia and the stichera with their refrains, he exclaims the first member of the litany ‘O God, save Thy people,’ given at the Litiya, and, upon the singing of ‘Lord, have mercy’ (12), adds the exclamation ‘By the mercy and compassions’ (from the 9th prayer at Matins) and, having descended, closes the Holy Doors and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, departs, removes the phelonion, sits at his place, and the choirs sing the Canon. If Matins with Vigil is celebrated, then the priest does not disrobe here, nor does he close the Holy Doors, but only after the exclamation ‘By the mercy and compassions’ takes the cross and, having exited through the Holy Doors, stands on the right side of the tetrapod, that is from the icon of the Savior, and, holding with his left hand the vessel with oil , and with his right — the brush (mazak), anoints in the form of a cross from the oil vessel, blessed at Vespers, the forehead of everyone who, having kissed the Gospel, approaches for the anointing, and the priest says to each one: ‘Christ is in our midst,’ and the anointed answers: ‘He is and shall be.’ In the Paschal season the priest says: ‘Christ is risen,’ and the anointed answers: ‘Truly He is risen.’
Having anointed everyone, he returns to the sanctuary through the Holy Doors and, having bowed low and having put away the vessel with the brush, closes the Holy Doors; and again having bowed low, departs and, having removed the phelonion, sits at his place.”
Canon
“Upon the exclamation ‘By the mercy and compassions,’ the priest anoints, and the choirs sing the Canon. If there was no All-Night Vigil, then the choirs sing the Canon, and the priest does not anoint.
The Canon, not in the Great Forty Days, usually consists of eight odes, and in the Forty Days – of nine. The eight odes of the canon, outside the Forty Days, are designated by numbers: 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th. Although the canon consists only of eight odes, nevertheless, its irmoi reach in number to the 9th ode; the second ode is not taken. The reason for this lies in the fact that the number of irmoi is different than the number of odes of Holy Scripture, the content of which they contain in an abbreviated form. However, because the content of the second ode of Holy Scripture corresponds only to the penitential season, the irmoi of the canon, except for the Lenten canon, do not include this ode, but only the eight aforementioned, without the second.
Of such canons at Matins, Great or Small, there can be either one, or two, or three, or four. One or two (usually two) occur on Feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos; whether there are two canons, or only one, their troparia are taken together to [make] 12, excluding the irmoi, and the irmoi twice. In other cases it is necessary to distinguish: for there can be a service of a Saint in the middle of a Feast, that is in the Fore- or Afterfeast of a Feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos, or the service of a Saint may fall outside a Feast, then either alone, or with the Octoechos service. In the first case, the troparia of each ode are taken to [make] 12 together with the irmos of the first canon, the irmoi of the other canons are not taken; for although they are presented at the beginning of their odes, they serve only as a model, or for the form of singing for their subsequent troparia. Only, if two Saints with their own services fall in the middle of a Feast, then the troparia of each ode are taken to [make] 14, together with the irmos of the first canon . In the second case, the troparia of each ode are taken to [make] 14, together with the irmos of the first: one irmos and 13 troparia . Upon the conclusion of the last troparion of each ode, the current Katavasia  is sung, if the irmos of some of the canons of the Feasts of the Lord or of the Theotokos is presented, or the general irmos of the Theotokos service of Tone 4 ‘I shall open my mouth.’ These irmoi of the aforementioned Feasts are used not only at Great Matins on the day of the Feasts themselves, but also at all Great Matins throughout the whole year within the limits defined by the Typikon.
Refrains to the odes of the canon are now not taken from the odes placed at the end of the Psalter (for we limit them to the penitential days of the Great Forty Days), but are used in the following manner:
1.	If it is a canon of a Feast of the Lord, we say: ‘Glory, O Lord, to Thy holy Transfiguration (or Nativity, or other, depending on the Feast).’ In the Cross canon: ‘Glory, O Lord, to Thy Cross and Crucifixion’ . In the Resurrection canon on Sunday: ‘Glory, O Lord, to Thy holy Resurrection.’ In the Resurrection and Cross [canon]: ‘Glory, O Lord, to Thy Cross and Resurrection.’ In the Paschal canon: ‘Christ is risen from the dead.’ In the Triadic canon: ‘O Most Holy Trinity, our God, glory to Thee.’ In the canon of the Descent of the Holy Spirit and in the canon of all other services of the Lord, Feasts and Penitential [services]: ‘Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.’
2.	If it is a canon of a service to the Theotokos: ‘O Most Holy Theotokos, save us.’
3.	If it is a canon of a service to a Saint, then his rank is named, as indicated in the Menaion, and the name is added: ‘Pray to God for us.’ E.g.: ‘Holy Hieromartyr Josaphat, pray to God for us.’ On the Feast of All Saints: ‘All Saints, pray to God for us.’
4.	In the canon for the Dead: ‘Rest, O Lord, the soul of Thy departed servant’ or in the plural: ‘The souls of Thy departed servants.’
Because at Matins usually there are several canons, each ode of which ends with a Theotokion, to the Theotokia of all canons, except the last, we add the aforementioned refrain to the Theotokos: ‘O Most Holy Theotokos, save us,’ and before the Theotokion of the last – we add ‘Both now,’ and before the last troparion of the last canon we add ‘Glory,’ regardless of whether it will be a Theotokion, or some other.
In a mixed canon, that is such a one where some troparia will be of one kind of Saints, and others – of another, as happens in the weekday service of the Octoechos, before each troparion a verse is added, according to its rank or content.
Before the irmoi we add nothing, but if there is one service of a Feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos, then at the 9th Ode, instead of the general refrains, we sing refrains proper (given at the 9th Ode of the canon of the Feast) to all its troparia, including to the penultimate and last, instead of ‘Glory, Both now,’ and also to its irmoi and Katavasia.
Although now we do not use the Odes of Holy Scripture presented at the end of the Psalter, excluding the Forty Days, nevertheless, we leave something from them, that is at the 8th Ode, instead of Glory – the refrain ‘Let us bless the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the Lord,’ and the refrain to the Katavasia of the 8th Ode: ‘We praise, we bless, we worship the Lord, praising and magnifying Him unto all ages,’ which is sung according to the tone of the Katavasia; also the Song of the Theotokos ‘My soul magnifies’ before the irmos of the 9th Ode of the canon, which we take also in the time of the Forty Days, and outside of it, with the exception of Feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos, on which, according to ancient typikons, it is not proper to take [it].
Before the Song of the Theotokos the deacon, or instead of him the priest, exclaims: ‘The Theotokos and Mother of the Light let us magnify in songs,’ which with us is used also on the aforementioned Great Feasts, when instead of ‘My soul magnifies,’ the irmos of the ode is sung . The Typikon orders the deacon or priest during the Song of the Theotokos to cense the Holy Table, iconostasis and the rest, as at the beginning.
After the 3rd, 6th and 9th Ode of the canon, immediately after the Katavasia, the Small Litany is taken (according to the model given at the first Kathisma of Matins), each with its own exclamation, and after the litany at the 3rd Ode the Sessional Hymn is sung, at the 6th – Kontakion and Ikos, and at the 9th – the Exaposteilarion (Hymn of Light) is read. Both the Kontakion and Ikos are taken once each, the Sessional Hymn on Feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos – twice, that is once – simply the Sessional Hymn, and the second time – with the refrain Glory, Both now. And the Exaposteilarion on Feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos is taken three times, that is twice – simply, and the third time – with the refrain Glory, Both now. On the Feast of a Polyeleos or non-Polyeleos Saint, which is celebrated, according to the Slavonic Typikon, on 6, the Sessional Hymn and his Exaposteilarion are taken twice , then Both now: his Theotokion. If the Saint has two Sessional Hymns or Exaposteilaria, then they are taken once each, that is the first – simply, the second – with the refrain Glory, then Both now: his Theotokion . When several services coincide, each with its own Sessional Hymn, Kontakion-Ikos and Exaposteilarion, then they are taken one after another, according to the order of services; however, the Kontakion-Ikos of the first service is taken at the 6th Ode in its place, and the Kontakion-Ikos of the second, according to the Slavonic typikons , is transferred to the 3rd Ode and goes immediately before the Sessional Hymn. The sequence of Sessional Hymns and Exaposteilaria in the middle of a Feast of the Lord and of the Theotokos ends with the Sessional Hymn or Exaposteilarion of the Feast. After the Katavasia of the 9th Ode, according to the Slavonic Typikon, ‘It is truly meet’ is taken, if it is not Sunday. If it is Sunday, ‘It is truly meet’ is not taken, but then, between the Small Litany and the Exaposteilarion (Exapostolarion) we sing, according to the tone of the Prokeimenon of the Liturgy, the troparion ‘Holy is the Lord our God’ (3)” .
From “Let everything that hath breath” to the end
“Upon the reading (aloud) of the Exaposteilarion follows the Praises (Khvalytni) – the Three Psalms; its first two verses are sung according to the tone of the first stichera which will be sung at the end of that same Three Psalms with its last verses just as the stichera at ‘Lord, I have cried’ are sung. To the 1st and 2nd verses of this psalm (‘Let everything that hath breath’) certain words are added, as presented below:
Verse 1. ‘Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord: Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the highest, to Thee belongs a hymn, O God’ .
Verse 2. ‘Praise Him, all His angels, praise Him, all His hosts, to Thee belongs a hymn, O God’.
And further according to the order the other verses are read until we reach the last four or six, which are to be sung with the four or six stichera. On Feasts of the Lord, of the Theotokos and of Polyeleos Saints usually there are four stichera, except for the last two or one, which are sung at ‘Glory, Both now.’ There can also be eight stichera of the Praises, as happens on Sundays, or on Feasts of the Lord, of the Theotokos and of Saints, if they fall on Sunday; however, refrains from the psalms of the Praises are needed only six, because to the last two stichera special refrains are added, given at the Aposticha stichera of Vespers.
On Feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos at Glory, Both now there is only one stichera, on Feasts of Polyeleos Saints: one – at Glory and the second (Theotokion) – at Both now; on Sundays: at Glory – the current Gospel stichera, one of the eleven, and at Both now – the Theotokion of the Horologion ‘Most blessed art thou.’
During the singing of the Doxastikon of the stichera of the Praises the priest vests in the phelonion and, having come to the front of the steps of the Holy Table and having bowed low, opens the Holy Doors and, having turned to the side of the Holy Table, stands there. Upon the conclusion of the stichera he exclaims: ‘Glory to Thee Who hast shown us the light.’
The Great Doxology and Trisagion with small bows are sung. The priest stands before the steps of the Holy Table and makes bows at the Trisagion. At the end of the Trisagion the priest bows low, exits through the Holy Doors to the tetrapod from its left side, that is from the icon of the Theotokos and, having taken the Gospel and having kissed it, withdraws by the other side of the tetrapod, likewise through the Holy Doors, places it on the Holy Table and stands there until the end of Matins. At this time, upon the conclusion of the Trisagion, the troparia are sung in the following manner:
If the service is only of a Feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos, one troparion of the Feast is sung.
If the service is only of a Polyeleos Saint, his troparion is sung, and also ‘Glory, Both now’: Theotokion from the Sunday ones, according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint.
If [it is] a Polyeleos Saint in the middle of a Feast of the Lord or of the Theotokos, then we do not take the Theotokia, but after the troparion we sing at ‘Glory, Both now’ the troparion of the Feast.
If [it is] a Sunday service on Sunday, then we sing only the Resurrection troparion, one of the two placed in the Horologion, without Theotokion; the first – ‘Today salvation has come to the world,’ when the tone is odd, that is 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th; and the second – ‘Having risen from the tomb,’ when the tone is even, that is 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th.
Upon the conclusion of the troparia the priest sings two litanies, namely ‘Have mercy on us, O God’ and ‘Let us complete,’ with the giving of peace, as given at Vespers, and also the dismissal, according to the model given at Great Vespers without Vigil. When the choirs begin the 1st Hour from ‘Come, let us worship’ with bows alternately, then the priest also, having bowed twice with the first choir, closes the Holy Doors, having bowed low in the direction of the Holy Table, exits to the sacristy and, having removed the phelonion, sits at his place behind the Holy Table.”
________________________________________
RUBRIC FOR DEACONS
“The deacons, if there are any, begin to act from the Prokeimenon, although it is not forbidden for them to act also from the beginning of Matins and to sing the litanies. At the Prokeimenon they exclaim everything just as at the Prokeimenon of Vespers; they themselves cense, but let them not venture to read the Gospel. The first deacon exclaims: ‘Let us pray to the Lord,’ the second: ‘And that we may be vouchsafed’; the first: ‘Wisdom, Upright, let us hear the Holy Gospel,’ the priest: ‘The reading is from the Holy Gospel according to (Name).’ The second deacon: ‘Let us be attentive,’ and the priest reads the Gospel. Also the first deacon: ‘O God, save Thy people’ etc. At the dismissal of Matins they act and recite everything just as was indicated for the dismissal of Great Vespers without Vigil.”
Note on sitting and standing
“At this Matins it is not proper to sit, but to stand:
•	at its very beginning;
•	at ‘God is the Lord’ and at the subsequent troparia;
•	at the ‘Magnification’ and at ‘The Angelic Council’; from the Prokeimenon to the Canon;
•	at the Song of the Theotokos;
•	at the first two verses of the psalms of the Praises;
•	from Glory, Both now of the stichera of the Praises to ‘Have mercy on us, O God’;
•	at the dismissal.”
 
ORDER OF DAILY MATINS
“From the beginning of Matins to the second Sessional Hymn inclusive everything happens just as at Great Matins without Vigil, with the exception of the censing at the beginning, which is prescribed in the Typikon, however, according to our custom of many years, is not practiced . After the second (or even the third)  Sessional Hymn the 50th Psalm is taken and immediately the Canon just as given at Great Matins, except for the Katavasia, which will not be the current one, nor after every ode, but only after the 3rd, 6th, 8th and 9th – the irmos of the last canon. At its 9th Ode, that is at ‘My soul magnifies,’ the priest censes just as at Great Matins. After the Canon – ‘It is truly meet’; after the Exaposteilarion – the Psalms of the Praises, simply, without singing and without the addition to the first two verses of the words: ‘Let everything that hath breath’ and ‘To Thee belongs’; after Glory, Both now usually the Small Doxology is read, before which the priest, having exited to the front of the Holy Doors says in the Forty Days: ‘To Thee belongs glory’ and exclaims: ‘Glory to Thee Who hast shown us the light.’ Outside the Forty Days, he does not say ‘To Thee belongs glory,’ but immediately exclaims: ‘Glory to Thee Who hast shown us the light’ and then the choirs read the Doxology. The priest stands there until the end of the litany ‘Let us complete,’ which follows after the Doxology, at it he also gives the peace, as at Vespers. After ‘Let us complete’ the priest withdraws to his place, having bowed low. The Aposticha is sung, and after it – ‘It is a good thing,’ Trisagion and the rest with ‘Our Father.’ After this the priest exclaims, standing at his place: ‘For Thine is the kingdom,’ also the troparion of the Saint is sung and Glory, Both now: the Dismissal Theotokion, according to the tone of the troparion of the Saint and according to the day of the week. In the Fore- and Afterfeast the Theotokion is not taken, but instead of it the troparion of the Feast is sung . When this troparion ends, the priest comes out to the front of the Holy Doors and sings the litany ‘Have mercy on us, O God’ and after its exclamation says: ‘Wisdom,’ the choir responds: ‘Bless,’ the priest sings: ‘Blessed is He Who Is and is pre-glorified ... unto ages of ages,’ choir: ‘Amen’ and immediately: ‘Confirm, O God’ with small bows. The priest after the last low bow withdraws to his place and the 1st Hour begins.”
Note on a Non-Polyeleos Saint with Great Doxology
“If formerly for a non-Polyeleos Saint a Great Doxology was prescribed, then there will be also four stichera of the Praises for him, and in this case, beginning from the Canon  to the end of Matins everything happens just as at Great Matins.”

ORDER OF THE USUAL HOURS
“The Order of these Hours is given in the Horo- or Prayer Book. The changeable parts are: troparia, kontakia and the commemoration of the current service at the dismissal.
Regarding troparia and kontakia let it be known:
1.	If at the Hours there is only one troparion, then it is taken with the refrain ‘Glory,’ then – the Theotokion of the Hours with the refrain ‘Both now.’ If there are two troparia and two kontakia, then the first troparion is taken simply, without a refrain, after [it] – the second with the refrain ‘Glory,’ and at the end – ‘Both now’ and the Theotokion of the Hour. The Kontakia are taken alternately, that is at the 1st and 6th – one, and at the 3rd and 9th – the second.
2.	At one Hour there cannot be more than two troparia and one kontakion. If in the Typikon more than two troparia and more than one kontakion are given, then they are taken alternately, that is: at the 1st and 6th Hour – the troparion of the first service, then Glory: troparion of the second service; at the 3rd and 9th – the troparion of the first service, and after – Glory: troparion of the third service. Kontakia, if there are two, are taken: one – at the 1st and 6th Hour, and the second – at the 3rd and 9th; if there are three, then at the 1st – the first, at the 3rd – the second, at the 6th – the third, and at the 9th – again the first.
3.	In older Menaia, which our Menaia also follow, troparia and kontakia are not given to every Saint, but in closer times we find them given in our Horologia. Therefore one should not wonder if regarding the use of troparia at the Hours the rubrics in some way do not agree with the Menaion and our Horo- or Prayer Book. For when a Saint had a troparion and kontakion, according to the ancient Typikon, they were taken at all Hours; but according to the Typikon of our Horo- and Prayer Books, in order not to repeat at all Hours on all days one and the same troparion and kontakion, for a certain variety at the 1st Hour – the troparion and kontakion of the day of the week, at the 3rd and 9th – of the Saint, and at the 6th – of the Temple.
The aforesaid concerns daily troparia and kontakia; on Sundays it is proper to take the Sunday troparion of the current tone at every Hour in this manner: at the 1st – the Sunday troparion alone, at the 3rd and 9th – the Sunday troparion, then Glory: to the Saint; at the 6th – the Sunday troparion and Glory: troparion of the Temple; kontakia – alternately, that is at the 1st – Sunday, at the 3rd – to the Saint, at the 6th – of the Temple and at the 9th – again Sunday. Similarly also in Fore- and Afterfeasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos, as also for Polyeleos Saints, their troparia are taken at every Hour, and the troparion of the Temple is not taken.
Regarding the commemoration which takes place at the dismissal of the Hours, let it be known that it is proper to commemorate the current services and as many as there are. For when two, or even three services coincide, it is proper to commemorate them all, one after another. If, for example, the Sunday service coincides with the Afterfeast of the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos and of some Saint, then it is necessary to commemorate all, exclaiming: ‘May Christ our True God, risen from the dead, through the prayers of His Most Pure Mother, whose Dormition and holy martyr (Name), whose memory we celebrate today’ etc.”
Here ends the text of the Lviv Synod.

ON VESPERS WITH LITURGY
At Vespers which is sung with the Liturgy there will be an Entrance and, after the Prokeimenon – readings; and then there will be neither a complete Vespers, nor a complete Liturgy. From Vespers its last part falls away, that is from the litany ‘Let us say all’ to its end; from the Liturgy, in turn, its initial part falls away, that is from the beginning to the Trisagion. Thus Vespers merges with the Liturgy as if into one order of Divine Service, and the connecting link of Vespers with the Liturgy at a Full Liturgy will be the Small Litany with the exclamation of the Trisagion, from which the Liturgy begins; and at the Liturgy of the Presanctified [Gifts] this link will be ‘Let my prayer act,’ which, according to our custom, the priest sings at the four sides of the Holy Table; immediately after it follows the litany ‘Let us say all,’ before it, in the case of a Polyeleos Saint, will be his Apostle and Gospel, and on the first three days of Passion Week – the Gospel of the day.
