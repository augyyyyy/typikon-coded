PART V
RUBRICS ABOUT TEMPLES
The temple rubrics used among us are of a double kind: some are borrowed from local Western Churches, which do not enter into the composition of our divine service, but are only added to it; others are natural to our divine service. Rubrics borrowed from Western Churches relate to the Holy Mysteries of the Eucharist, which are exposed on the holy table on the day of the temple feast and with which a procession takes place around the church. First, it befits us to provide the rubrics for the exposition and procession, and later – for the others.
Chapter I
1. ABOUT THE EXPOSITION OF THE HOLY MYSTERIES ON THE HOLY TABLE
On one of the days preceding the feast, the priest shall consecrate two Lambs at the Liturgy: with one let him communicate, and the other, having placed [It] in the pyx [darokhranylnytsia], let him keep until the day of the feast. Let him do all this according to the rubric given for Great Thursday here, on p. 385. When the very day of the feast comes, after the completion of the Proskomedia, immediately before the beginning of the Liturgy, the deacons (or the priest himself) cense everything according to custom and the exposition of the Holy Mysteries takes place exactly as was noted for the feast of the Most Holy Eucharist here, on p. 449.
After the Ambo [prayer], let the Holy Mysteries be hidden in the tabernacle [kyvot], and before Vespers exposed again, for it is not fitting to leave the Holy Mysteries without those who venerate Them and without a sufficient quantity of candles, of which, according to the prescription of the Lviv Synod, there should be at least six wax ones .
2. ABOUT THE PROCESSION WITH THE HOLY MYSTERIES
AT VESPERS
Before the beginning of Vespers, the priest, dressed in all sacerdotal [vestments], and the deacon – in all diaconal vestments, having come before the steps of the holy table, open the holy doors and the first deacon, having laid aside the Gospel to the right side, takes the Holy Mysteries from the tabernacle [kyvot] and places Them on the iliton; the priest censes Them thrice over all, as at the beginning of the Liturgy, places Them on the skynia^[A] on the folded iliton and, having placed the Gospel again in the middle of the holy table, exclaims: "Bless, Master," and the priest, standing with the deacons at the holy table, begins: "Blessed is our God." Vespers is sung with an Entrance. The priest departs from the holy table only at the Entrance, and the deacons – also at the litanies and after the prokimenon for the sermon, if there be one; then the Holy Mysteries are covered with a veil.
Before the dismissal of Vespers, all kneel, and the deacon takes the Holy Gospel from the middle of the holy table and, having placed it on the right side, removes the Holy Mysteries from the skynia and places [Them] on the folded iliton. The priest censes Them thrice with a bowing of the head and, having given away the censer, takes upon himself the omophorets [humeral veil], approaches the Holy Mysteries and, having bowed low, takes Them with both hands, with the help of the deacon, turns right to the people, begins some pious hymn and goes out through the holy doors into the church; he enters under the baldachin and proceeds to the church doors, preceded by deacons with censers, who incessantly cense the Holy Mysteries from the sides; after them follow other priests in phelons, some – only in epitrachelia, with lighted candles in their hands, in two wings, likewise – the church brotherhood, afterwards – four girls with icons, banner-bearers and the cross-bearer. Under the sounds of bells, the procession goes out of the church and encircles it, beginning from its northern side, and returning from the southern side. When the priest with the Holy Mysteries reaches the middle of the northern side, the procession stops, interrupts the singing, all kneel, and the priest blesses all the present people with the Holy Mysteries four times, that is, first directly before himself, then – to the right side, then – behind and finally – to the left, saying each time in a quiet voice: "Save, O God, Thy people and bless Thine inheritance." Similarly it happens on the eastern, southern and western sides . After the blessing on the western side, the procession enters the church: first the priest with the Holy Mysteries, other sacred ministers, then – the rest of the procession and the people. Then the priest places the Holy Mysteries on the holy table, on the folded iliton, and, having laid aside the omophorets, kneels and censes the Holy Mysteries thrice. All kneel, and the priest, together with other sacred ministers, sings the verses of the supplicatory hymn "Holy God." All the people repeat each of its verses. After the completion of the litiya, the priest, having censed the Holy Mysteries thrice and having taken upon himself the omophorets, approaches the holy table and, having bowed low, takes the Holy Mysteries and, having turned right to the people, sings piously the verse of the hymn of St. Ambrose "Save Thy people, O Lord" twice, and the people repeat the same. The third time the priest [sings]: "Save Thy people, O Lord, and bless Thine inheritance"; singing: "and bless," he blesses the people solemnly crosswise, making a half-turn from the right to the left side.
While the choir sings the continuation of the Ambrosian hymn, the priest places the Holy Mysteries on the holy table, goes down before the steps and, having laid aside the omophorets and having censed Them thrice, kneels together with all others until the deacon hides the Holy Mysteries in the skynia. Then the Great Dismissal takes place, according to custom.
On one of the days following the feast, the priest at the Liturgy shall consume after his communion also the Lamb hidden in the ark [kyvot], taking It from the vessel in which It stands. Let him do so if he has a Monstrance [Monstrantsia], for if the Holy Mysteries are exposed only in the pyx [darokhranylnytsia], none of this will happen.

Chapter II
TEMPLE RUBRICS,
which enter into the composition of our divine service
These rubrics are either general or specific. General [ones] are applicable to many cases, specific [ones] – only to some. We shall present first the general rubrics, and then – the specific.
1. GENERAL RUBRICS 
1.	On a temple feast, even if it be of a saint of a lower rank, an All-Night Vigil must be celebrated. So we do, and so holds the Eye of the Church in Chapter 4, concerning temples .
2.	The feast of a temple saint, even if of a lower rank, exceeds even a feast of a saint with a Vigil, primarily in that, when it falls on a Sunday, it includes at Matins before the Canon the Prokimenon, the Gospel, and the Sunday Sticheron [after the Gospel], exactly as a Feast of the Theotokos; also, the Gospel Sticheron is transferred from the "Praises" to the end of Matins. Besides this, if it falls on a weekday, it excludes at the Liturgy the Apostle and Gospel of the day, which is then read on the day before the feast. Finally, the temple feast of a saint has its Apodosis, which takes place on the very day of the feast at Vespers for the following day, with an Entrance, as on a Feast of the Lord. In this Apodosis at "Lord, I have cried," there will be 6 stichera: 3 of the temple and 3 of the daily saint; Glory: of the temple; Both now: Theotokion from the Sunday [Octoechos] (Dogmatic) according to the tone of the Doxastikon. If the temple is of the Lord or of the Theotokos, then also Glory, Both now: of the temple. On Friday evening for Saturday, we always sing the Dogmatic of the tone that is being given away. After the Prokimenon – "Let us all say." Aposticha of the temple with its verses, Glory: of the temple, Both now: Theotokion from the Sunday [Octoechos], according to the tone of the Doxastikon. If the temple is of the Lord or of the Theotokos, then Both now: of the temple. At the end: Troparion of the temple, Glory: Troparion of the daily saint, Glory, Both now: of the temple. Great Dismissal with the commemoration of the temple and the daily saint. At this Vespers, the service of the temple saint concludes; however, a temple saint does not have an Apodosis if the following day falls on a Sunday, or a Polyeleos saint.
3.	If the feast of a temple saint falls in the midst of a feast, that is, during the Forefeast, Afterfeast, or Apodosis of a feast – observe the rubric of a Saint with Vigil in the Afterfeast, whether on a Sunday or on a weekday here, on pp. 104-105 , only on Sunday, at Matins, we sing the Prokimenon, Gospel and Sticheron of the temple; at the Praises – Glory: of the temple, and the Gospel Sticheron – after the dismissal of Matins .
4.	On the very day of the feast, after the Ambo [prayer], in our lands, a Blessing of Water usually takes place outside the church, to where a procession goes: in front – the cross-bearer, then – the censer-bearer, the deacon with the Gospel, and the priest with a hand cross. It befits the church servers to carry there also the boat with incense, the sprinkler with the holy water vessel, a glass [cup], and a towel, so that the cross may be wiped after immersing it in the water, as well as the hands of the priest. After the dismissal of the Liturgy, the Polychronion is sung for the Ecumenical Pontiff, the Emperor, the Metropolitan, one's own Bishop, all present sacred ministers, and all people of the parish.
5.	On the day following the feast, according to local custom, a Liturgy for the deceased of the parish with a Parastas is sung, at which it is not fitting to take anything of the feast, but everything only – for the deceased.
6.	The feast of a temple saint is usually transferred among us to the following Sunday; in throne [cathedral] temples – it is celebrated on its own day.

LITANY ON THE EXALTATION OF THE PRECIOUS CROSS 
1.	Have mercy on us, O God, according to Thy great mercy, we pray Thee, hearken and have mercy. Let us all say.
2.	Again we pray for our Most Holy Ecumenical Pontiff (name) the Pope of Rome, for our God-loving and God-protected Emperor (name), for the state, victory, welfare, peace, health, salvation and for the remission of their sins and that the Lord God may help and especially assist them in everything and subdue under their feet every enemy and adversary. Let us all say.
3.	Again we pray for our Most Reverend Archbishop Metropolitan Kyr (name), for our God-loving Bishop Kyr (name), for our spiritual fathers and for all our brethren in Christ, for health, salvation and for the remission of their sins. Let us all say.
4.	Again we pray for every Christian soul: for health, salvation and remission of their sins. Let us all say.
5.	Again we pray for all those who serve and have served in this holy temple: for health, salvation and for the remission of their sins. Let us all say.
RULE OF SERVICES OF THE WHOLE YEAR
Notes
1.	When a service is transferred from a weekday to Sunday, the service of the saint falling on that Sunday is transferred to the weekday of the service being transferred to Sunday.
2.	In the Menologion we will present the names only of those saints who have a service, others – no, for we do not have to mention them, but only the former.
3.	Let the one who officiates not omit the services of feasts on 6 with Great Doxology and services of feasts of a lower rank compared to them. With the services of Polyeleos feasts and of a higher rank compared to them, let him not combine services for the deceased, but take only the service of the feast with the intention for the deceased .
4.	Services of the whole year: some – immovable, that is of the Menaion, and others – movable, that is of the Triodia and Octoechos. We will present first the Rule of immovable services, and then – of movable .
5.	Since the services of the Menaion are diverse, so that the reader may know what kind of service he should take, to each service on the left side we add one of the signs determining the kind of service.

EXPLANATION OF THE TABLE
1.	The table contains 35 columns of Sundays of the whole year, according to the number of 35 Paschal keys and 35 corresponding Paschal days.
2.	At the top of the table, that is, in its 1st transverse row, all 35 Paschal keys are indicated, under each of which extends a row, or column, of Sundays of the whole year, with the indication of the day of the month within which these Sundays fall, and their dates or names. The names of the months are given outside the column, on the left side, and separated from one another by transverse step-like lines; the day of the month is given in the column, and the number or name of the Sunday – outside the column, on the right side of the table.
3.	In the 7th row are given all 35 days on which the Sunday of the Publican may fall, on which the Triodion begins.
4.	In the 8th row are given in double print all 35 Paschal days, corresponding to the 35 Paschal keys.
5.	In the five rows that are between the Publican and the Paschal keys, are indicated all 35 Sundays that may fall between Theophany and the Publican, that is, the Sunday after Theophany and the four last ordinary ones (29th, 30th, 31st and 32nd). However, since not all these Sundays will always take place, the explanation of which we gave on p. 144 (for this depends on whether Pascha falls earlier or later), between these five Sundays some places may be unfilled, and this means that then the Sundays corresponding to them, indicated on the right side of the table, will not take place. For example, under the Paschal key "A" all places are unfilled; this means that none of these 5 Sundays will be taken, but immediately after Theophany – the Triodion.
6.	Of the Triodion Sundays, we presented only three, that is, the middle one – the Resurrection, and the two extreme ones, that is [Page 250] the Publican and All Saints; the rest of the Sundays that are between them, we do not present, for one can conveniently keep them in memory even without the table, because usually they have proper names and services that correspond to these names.
7.	For the Sundays preceding the Sunday of the Publican, we do not present either the tone or the Sunday Gospel, for they depend on the past Pascha, and therefore one must look for them at the end of the table, within the limits of January and February under the Paschal key of the past Pascha.
8.	Next to some Sundays, Latin letters are printed in double type. This means that then, with the Gospel of this Sunday, another must also be combined, of one of the 10 specific Sundays of the Menaion, presented after the table with the corresponding Latin letters .
9.	After this, if you want to find out which Sundays in a certain year should be taken between Theophany and the Publican, seek first of all the Paschal key of the following Pascha, using Table I or Table II, and under it in Table III you will find these Sundays; only, if the year is leap, follow immediately the next column. And if you prefer to find out which Sunday, tone and Sunday Gospel are to be taken on one of the Sundays after the Descent of the Holy Spirit, then having determined the Paschal key of this year and having gone down its column to the place and day of the Sunday, follow from it along the transverse row to the right side of the table and you will find all this.
10.	Regarding the Apodosis of the Meeting, which we present in the last row of the table, know that under the key "A" the number "0" means that the Apodosis will not be then; under keys from "R" to the end, the number "9" means that the Apodosis will be on February 9, and under others – it will be on different days, depending on the keys; only in a leap year follow immediately the next column. Paschal keys must be determined from the following Pascha.
 
RUBRIC
ABOUT THE HOLY DOORS AND THE CURTAIN OF THE ICONOSTASIS
According to the rubric of the Greek Euchologion, the holy doors are opened only εις την αρχήν του μεγάλου Εσπερινού, οτε θυμια μονός ο Ιερεύς, εις τας εισόδους πασάς, ήγουν των Εσπερινών και της Λειτουργίας, και του αγίου Ευαγγελίου. Ωσαύτως ανοίγεται και από του Μετά φόβου... μέχρι της συμπληρώσεως της θείας Λειτουργίας.
The curtain, according to the present custom of Athonite monasteries, at the Liturgy, after the completion of the Proskomedia, is drawn open, and at the "Great Entrance" is drawn shut; at "Especially" it is drawn open, and at "And grant that with one mouth" it is drawn shut; at "With fear" it is drawn open and so remains until the conclusion of the Liturgy . According to the former custom of the Athonite Mountain, when one priest serves, that is without a deacon, the curtain is drawn shut at the "Great Entrance" and is not drawn open until the end of communion. Besides this, it remains drawn open at Vespers and at Matins from the 1st Hour and at the Moleben. When the Hours are celebrated without Liturgy, it is drawn open for the reading of the Apostle and drawn shut after the dismissal of the "Typika" .
The End and Glory to God.
Bless, O All-Holy Theotokos, this work for the good of God's holy Churches. Amen.
