CHEESEFARE WEEK
Notes
1.	The Synod of Lviv permits meat during this week, except on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, on the condition of [reciting] 5 "Our Father" and 5 "Virgin Theotokos" for the laity and Psalm 50 for the clergy. On the other three days, we use dairy products.
2.	The divine services of this week approach the Lenten [order], however, gradually, for Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday have only certain parts in the Triodion, while all other parts are filled by the Octoechos and Menaion. Wednesday and Friday have in the Triodion a fuller order of Lenten character with prostrations . Saturday and Sunday, although they have a full service in the Triodion, nevertheless are not of Lenten form, as are all Saturdays and Sundays of Great Lent. The parts that Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday have in the Triodion are as follows: 1. Aposticha at Vespers and at Matins. 2. 2nd Sessional Hymn at Matins before the Canon. 3. Canon of the Triodion, usually double, that is, with two heirmoi.
The Odes of the Triodion triodion [three-ode canon] in the first five days of this week, as of all weeks of Great Lent, follow this sequence:
On Monday: 1st, 8th, and 9th.
On Tuesday: 2nd, 8th, and 9th.
On Wednesday: 3rd, 8th, and 9th.
On Thursday: 4th, 8th, and 9th.
On Friday: 5th, 8th, and 9th.
RUBRIC
ON CHEESEFARE MONDAY, TUESDAY, AND THURSDAY
Everything – according to the general rule for a saint without Polyeleos on weekdays, only:
AT VESPERS
On Sunday and on Monday evening 
Instead of the Aposticha of the Octoechos, there will be the Aposticha of the Triodion with the two usual verses of the Horologion. If there is a Doxastikon for the saint, then we select the Theotokion from the Octoechos according to the tone of the Doxastikon.
AT COMPLINE: The Canon of the Theotokos is not taken .
AT MATINS
1.	Instead of the 2nd Sessional Hymn of the Octoechos, it will be – of the Triodion.
2.	Canons: where there is no triodion [three-ode canon], there will be two of the Octoechos and one of the saint, as usual; but where there is a triodion, both canons of the Octoechos are omitted and the canon of the saint is sung alone or two together (if there are two) with heirmos on 6  and both canons of the triodion on 8 . The Katavasia will be after Odes 3, 6, 8, and 9, and also where there is a triodion, always the heirmos of the last canon.
3.	Aposticha of the Triodion with the usual verses of the Horologion.
ON CHEESEFARE WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY
Note
In view of the Lenten form of the church services of these days, violet vestments should be used, since at Matins, instead of "God is the Lord", "Alleluia" is sung on these days, as on the days of Great Lent; therefore, the Typikon prescribes three prostrations (small) at the beginning of Vespers at the Trisagion and at "O come, let us worship", and also after the pre-introductory psalm at "Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, glory to Thee, O God" , as well as after each of the three antiphons of the Kathisma (although now we read only the beginning of the Kathisma), after "Vouchsafe, O Lord", and after the Trisagion following "Now letteest Thou Thy servant depart". In addition to this, the Aposticha will be of the Triodion.
RUBRIC
On Tuesday and Thursday evening
AT VESPERS
1.	From the beginning to the troparia after "Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart", everything – according to the general rubric for a saint without Polyeleos on weekdays, however, with prostrations.
2.	After "Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart" with the Trisagion – 3 troparia, that is, "Virgin Theotokos", Glory: To the Baptist, Both now: "Intercede", each with a prostration at the end, and "Beneath thy tender mercy", without a prostration .
3.	From "Lord, have mercy" (40) to the end, everything – as in the Horologion; however, at the last Trisagion and at "Blessed be the name of the Lord", which must be said before the psalm "I will bless the Lord", there will be three prostrations (small); and at the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16 prostrations , that is, 3 great, 12 small, and again one great, as at the daily Midnight Office after "Thou Who at all times" . Dismissal with the usual commemorations of the service of the day and the saint.
Notes on Prostrations
1.	The prostrations we make at the three first troparia, according to the Typikon – are not great, but small, although due to ignorance of the rubric, or due to excessive piety, great ones are made among us. For here this prostration is called simply metanoia, and with the addition megale [great] it is given only at the prayer of St. Ephrem and never at the end of Vespers, after the litany "Have mercy on us, O God". Likewise at the Great Canon the rubric does not prescribe great prostrations, but simply metanoias.
2.	Neither Greek nor Slavonic rubrics give the form of the great or small prostration. However, according to custom it will be thus: he who makes a great prostration falls on his knees and touches the ground with his forehead; he who makes a small prostration does not fall on his knees, nor touches the ground with his forehead, but only crossing himself reaches the ground with his right hand, or only to the knees as the Synod of Lviv prescribes in Title V "On the Holy Liturgy", in the prayers before the iconostasis before the Proskomedia . We reach the ground with the right hand when we bow to the Holy Mysteries; only to the knees when we bow to holy icons, or at various supplications. However, our people in these parts do not have the custom, when bowing, to extend hands to the ground, or to the knees, but only crossing themselves to bow low before the Holy Mysteries, and higher – in other circumstances. We suppose, however, that at small Lenten prostrations we should reach the knees with the hand, for throughout the whole year at the Trisagion and at "O come, let us worship" we make prostrations, not reaching the knees with the hand .
AT GREAT COMPLINE
Note on Prostrations
We make three small prostrations: 1. At each Trisagion (which will be five times), except the Trisagion after the supplicatory verses "O All-holy Lady", for immediately after them, before the Trisagion, follows "O God, absolve", at which there were already three prostrations. 2. At each of the three "O come, let us worship" . 3. At "Alleluia" after the first and second Trisagion. 4. At "O God, absolve" after the supplicatory verses to the Most Holy Theotokos. 5. At each supplicatory verse – one small prostration and at the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16 prostrations: 4 great and 12 small .
RUBRIC
The rubric for Great Compline is here on pp. 26-27, only:
1.	After the Creed, the prostrations at the supplicatory verses take place thus: The 1st choir begins: "O All-holy Lady Theotokos, pray to God for us", and the 2nd choir makes a prostration, then rises and responds, and the 1st choir makes a prostration. So also at all other supplicatory verses. And when we say "O God, be merciful to me, a sinner" (3), both choirs sing together and make three prostrations (Greek Triodion, Monday of the 1st week of Lent).
2.	After "It is truly meet" we do not sing the Troparion "O Lord of Hosts, be with us" with its verses, but the usual troparia, as at Small Compline, that is: of the weekday, of the Temple, and "O God of our fathers" with the other three ; and on the days of Great Lent we sing "O Lord of Hosts, be with us".
AT THE MIDNIGHT OFFICE
We make three small prostrations: at each Trisagion, at both "O come, let us worship" and at each Glory: "The Blameless". At the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16, that is 4 great and 12 small.
AT MATINS
Note
We make prostrations according to the rubric of Lenten Matins: 1. At "Alleluia" of each "Glory" of the Kathismata – three prostrations . 2. After "It is truly meet" – 1 prostration . 3. At the Doxology  – 3 prostrations . 4. At the final Trisagion – 3 prostrations. 5. At the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16 prostrations: 4 great and 12 small .
RUBRIC
1.	From the beginning to the end of the litany "In peace let us pray to the Lord", everything – as usual for every day.
2.	Instead of "God is the Lord" we sing Alleluia in the current tone of the Octoechos and the Trinity Hymns of the tone.
3.	Two Kathismata with the usual prostrations at "Glory"; after the 1st Kathisma – Sessional Hymn of the Octoechos; after the 2nd – Sessional Hymn of the Triodion, then Psalm 50 and immediately – Canon .
4.	Canons 3 [making] 14: first of the Octoechos (the second of the Octoechos is not taken) with heirmos on 6, of the Menaion of the saint on 4, and of the Triodion on 4. In those odes where the triodion [three-ode canon] occurs, we sing the canon of the Triodion on 6 and both canons of the triodion together on 8, and one more separate troparion with the refrain "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", and instead of the Katavasia it will be the heirmos of the second canon of the triodion. In the odes in which there is no triodion, we suppose that the Katavasia will be the heirmos of the last canon, that is, of the Triodion, after each ode, as given in the Triodion on Cheesefare Friday, for these two days have a common rubric, although for Wednesday it is given imprecisely. The Canon of the Octoechos and Menaion in these odes, according to the rubric of the Greek Triodia, is omitted . The rubrics of the Slavs, for whom the Greek length is not enough, prescribe transferring the odes of the Menaion canon to the preceding ones, in which the triodion has no place, and they sing on Wednesday the 1st ode of the Octoechos with heirmos on 4, the 1st and 3rd odes of the Menaion (without Theotokia) on 6 and the Triodion on 4. On Friday – the 4th ode of the Octoechos on 4, the 4th and 5th odes of the Menaion on 6 and the Triodion on 4. Similarly, the 6th ode of the Octoechos on 4, the 6th and 8th of the Menaion on 6 and the Triodion on 4. Also the 6th ode of the Octoechos on 4, the 7th and 9th of the Menaion on 6 and the Triodion on 4. The Biblical Odes in the Psalter we do not sing . To the troparia of the canon we chant the usual refrains (on pp. 29-30). After the 3rd Ode – Sessional Hymn to the Saint, after the 6th – Kondakion to the Saint, and if there is none, then we recite the Martyricon of the Octoechos of the current tone, given at the end of the Triodion, after the Sessional Hymns of Matins. In general, in our modern Horologia kondakia are given to all saints . After the 9th Ode – Trinity Exaposteilarion of the tone.
5.	Before the Small Doxology the priest exclaims: "To Thee belongs glory".
6.	Aposticha of the Triodion.
7.	After "It is a good thing" with the Trisagion – Troparion "Standing in the temple", then "Lord, have mercy" (40) and the rest with 16 prostrations, as in the Horologion at the end of Matins.
AT THE HOURS
Everything – according to the Lenten rubric of Holy Great Lent, except the Stichology of the Psalter, which is not taken here. Therefore, it will be:
1.	Three small prostrations: at "O come, let us worship", at the Trisagions, at Alleluia after the three psalms, at "How shall we call thee"; and at the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16 usual ones .
2.	After the conclusion of the three psalms with Alleluia, the troparion is sung, called also the Prokeimenon, with two verses in the tone of the Prokeimenon. "The appointed reader (or priest) sings in the middle of the church the Troparion 'In the morning' (at the 1st Hour, and at the others – the specific one), and we sing loudly the same and bend our knees to the ground. Exactly so at the other two verses and again the same troparion" . This bending of the knees is done three times: once – after the singing of the troparion before the verse, once – after the singing of the troparion after the 1st verse, and once – after the singing of the troparion after the 2nd verse . After singing the troparion with its verses, we say Glory, Both now: Theotokion and make three prostrations. (At the 6th Hour, immediately after the Theotokion, there will be the Troparion of the Prophecy and one reading of the Prophecy between two Prokeimena in the Triodion).
3.	Then we sing "Direct my steps" with 4 verses, that is: "Direct my steps" twice, "Deliver me" twice, "Make Thy face to shine" twice and "Let my mouth be filled" three times. These verses – only at the 1st Hour, and at the others – only one troparion without verses.
4.	After the Trisagion, instead of the Kondakion, the Lenten Troparia are sung, which are in the Horologion.
5.	"Lord, have mercy" (40), "Thou Who at all times" and the rest with the prayer of St. Ephrem and 16 prostrations.

2.	We do not make prostrations at Vespers of these Sundays from the beginning of Vespers, but from "Vouchsafe, O Lord".

At "More honorable" of each of the 6 verses of the Song of the Theotokos – 1 prostration. 3. At "It is truly meet" – 1 prostration. 4. At "Glory to God in the highest" – 3 prostrations. 5. At the final Trisagion – 3 prostrations. 6. At the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16 prostrations, that is 12 small and 4 great.
RUBRIC
1.	From the beginning to the end of the litany "In peace let us pray to the Lord", everything, just as on every day.
2.	Instead of "God is the Lord" we sing Alleluia in the sequential tone of the Octoechos.
3.	We sing three Trinity Hymns of the current tone, given in the Horologion, three for each tone. They are all sung three times with the refrain "Glory" to the second, and "Both now" – to the third. At each first one we make a commemoration of the weekday service, at the second – a commemoration of all saints, at the third – a commemoration of the Theotokos. However, since the weekday service of the week changes daily, and the troparia are sung the same each day of the week (except Saturdays and Sundays, on which, because they are not Lenten, the Trinity Hymns are not sung), at the end of each first Trinity Hymn a colon is given, which signifies that the troparion must be completed with the commemoration of the weekday service, the form of which is indicated at the end of the 3rd troparion of Tone 1.
Note
These three commemorations we make also at the Exaposteilaria following the canon. But the Lenten Exaposteilarion has only one troparion in each tone, which is sung three times, therefore, when it is sung the first time, the commemoration of the weekday service is added to it, when – the second time, with the refrain "Glory", then – the commemoration of all saints, and when the third time, with the refrain "Both now", then – the commemoration of the Theotokos. These commemorations are added where the colon is given, that is before "And save me".
4. Three Kathismata with their Sessional Hymns, the Sessional Hymns of which, sung after the 1st Kathisma, are of the Octoechos of the current tone, given also at the end of the Triodion. The Sessional Hymns sung after the 2nd and 3rd Kathismata are of the Triodion.
5. Psalm 50 and the first petition of the great litany "Save, O God", and after the exclamation "Through the mercy and compassion" immediately – the Canon.
6. Odes and Canons. The Biblical Odes, given at the end of the Psalter, are intertwined with the odes of the canon, as given: before the ode of the canon the corresponding ode of the Psalter is recited, leaving its last verses for refrains to the troparia of the canon, in such quantity as there will be troparia in the ode of the canon, including the heirmos, except two, for to the penultimate troparion we refrain "Glory", and to the last – "Both now". The 2nd Ode is recited in full before the ode of the canon, and to the troparia of its canon we refrain: "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee". According to our ancient custom, the Odes of the Psalter are recited only in those odes in which the triodion occurs, and in the other odes we refrain the usual refrains to the troparia of the canon. The Greek Typikon prescribes singing the Odes of the Psalter in the tone of the Menaion canon, but now we do not even know what their melody was.
The Canons will be only of the Menaion and Triodion, for the Octoechos, according to the Greek rubric, during Great Lent is not sung, with the exception of Sundays. In some odes there will be 3 canons on 14, that is of the Saint of the Menaion with heirmos on 6 and both canons of the Triodion on 8: one on 4 and the second on 4. In some odes there will be only one canon of the saint on 4, and in the second ode there will be only two canons of the Triodion on 8, with heirmos on 9. This difference regarding the number of canons and their troparia in the odes arises because the Triodion canons do not occur daily in all odes, but in general only in three odes in the following sequence:
On Monday: 1st, 8th and 9th.
On Tuesday: 2nd, 8th and 9th.
On Wednesday: 3rd, 8th and 9th.
On Thursday: 4th, 8th and 9th.
On Friday: 5th, 8th and 9th.
On Saturday: 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th.
Therefore, there will be:
On Monday: at Odes 1, 8, and 9 – 3 canons on 14, that is of the Menaion with heirmos on 6 and both canons of the triodion on 8, and afterwards – one more separate troparion of the Triodion with the refrain "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", and the Katavasia – Heirmos of the 2nd canon of the triodion. At other odes there will be only one canon of the saint on 4, with heirmos on 5; only at Odes 3 and 6 the canon of the saint is read without the heirmos, for it is taken afterwards, as Katavasia .
On Tuesday: at the 2nd Ode, since the saint does not have this ode, there will be only two canons of the triodion on 8, and afterwards – one more separate troparion and Katavasia – Heirmos of the 2nd canon of the triodion; at the 8th and 9th Odes – 3 canons on 14 exactly as on Monday. At other odes there will be only the canon of the Menaion on 4 exactly as on Monday.
On Wednesday: at the 3rd, 8th, and 9th Odes there will be 3 canons on 14 exactly as at the 1st, 8th, and 9th Odes on Monday. And at other odes there will be only one canon of the saint on 4, as on Monday.
On Thursday: at the 4th, 8th, and 9th Odes there will be 3 canons on 14, as on Monday. At other odes – only the canon of the saint on 4 and the rest, as on Monday.
On Friday: at the 5th, 8th, and 9th Odes there will be 3 canons on 14, as on Monday; and at other odes – only one of the saint on 4.
On Saturday: at the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Odes there will be 3 canons: one of the saint and two of the Triodion, at other odes there will be two canons: of the temple and of the saint; however, for Saturday a separate rubric will be given, since Saturday is not a Lenten day.
•	If two saints fall, then we read both their canons together on 6 , that is of the first saint with heirmos on 3 and of the second without heirmos on 3. So also to the saint on 6.
The Katavasia will be always the heirmos of the last canon either of the triodion, or of the Menaion: of the triodion where there will be a triodion, and where there will be only the Menaion, then the Katavasia of the Menaion will be only after Odes 3 and 6, for at the 8th and 9th there will always be a triodion and therefore there will always be the Katavasia of the triodion.
A more precise example of the combination of the Odes of the Psalter with the Odes of the Canon is given at the 1st Ode in the Moscow Typikon, and is presented as follows: "After this we begin: 'Let us sing to the Lord' in the tone of the canon of the Menaion of the saint of the day and the verses of the odes are recited hurriedly, each choir – its verse, until they reach 'The waters became thick' and from this they begin verses on 14, and we sing the Menaion with heirmos on 6. And we sing thus: the first choir reads the verse 'The waters became thick' and sings the heirmos. The second choir reads the second verse 'The enemy said' and, after it, – the troparion of the canon, and in sequence verses by choirs up to 'Then hastened'. From the verse 'Then hastened' we begin the triodion of Kyr Joseph on 4. And at 'The Lord reigning' we sing the 2nd triodion of Kyr Theodore the Studite, and one choir sings the troparion, and the second choir – the 2nd verse and the troparion. After this both choirs, having united, sing: Glory: Trinity Hymn, in a higher voice, Both now: Theotokion. Then we sing in the highest voice: 'Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee', and we sing the other troparion of Theodore, because the ode has 5 troparia. At the end we sing the Katavasia – heirmos of the second canon" .
Regarding the refrains to the troparia of the canon, know that in order to find the number of refrains as quickly as possible, the last four, six, and eight verses of the Biblical Odes (except the 2nd, for it is read in full before the heirmos) from the bottom up are marked in the middle of the song, or on the side, with the inscription: "on 4, on 6, on 8". But on 14 they are not counted off, since 6 verses from 8 upwards are easily counted. However, the counting of 14 verses in current Psalters does not coincide exactly with the counting in previous Psalters, for where the rubrics place the 14th verse at "The waters became thick", current Psalters place the 14th verse at "The enemy said", and "The waters became thick" moves to the 15th verse. The 6th Ode has only 12 verses, so do not forget to divide these two verses of it on 4. The 9th Ode, one, of the Theotokos, is sung whole before the heirmos with "More honorable", and the other, of Zachariah, is sung whole in the refrains, and in those editions where there are only 13 verses, one verse must be divided into 2.
The last edition of the Lviv Psalter does not give the counting of the last verses, except for the 9th Ode; and, in general, in recent editions they did not care about the counting of verses.
After the 3rd Ode – Sessional Hymn of the Saint, after the 6th – Kondakion and Ikos of the Saint; if the saint does not have this, then the Martyric Sessional Hymn of the Octoechos of the current tone , given also at the end of the Triodion. After the 9th Ode – "It is truly meet" and after the litany – Exaposteilarion of the tone, which is in the Horologion, three times, with refrains and commemorations, as the Trinity Hymns, here on page 338, in the note.
1.	Before the Small Doxology the priest exclaims: "To Thee belongs glory" and the rest, and at "Glory to God in the highest" we make three prostrations.
2.	Aposticha of the Triodion, Glory: of the saint, if there be, Both now: Usual Theotokion in the tone of "Glory".
3.	"It is a good thing" twice; at the Trisagion – 3 prostrations and, after "Our Father", – Troparion "Standing in the temple"; then "Lord, have mercy" (40) and the rest with 16 prostrations at the prayer of St. Ephrem and, after the last prostration, immediately – "O come, let us worship" three times and the 1st Hour.
 
AT THE HOURS
1.	We make 3 small prostrations: at "O come, let us worship", at each Trisagion, at "Alleluia", which is after the three psalms, and at "Alleluia" after each antiphon; at each of the three singings of the troparion with two verses we bend the knees  and, after the Theotokion, – 3 prostrations, and at the prayer of St. Ephrem – 16 usual ones.
2.	After the three psalms with "Alleluia" – Kathisma proper according to the Lenten marker of the Psalter, except the 1st Hour on Monday and the 1st and 9th Hours on Friday, for then there will be no Kathisma.
3.	Troparion ("In the morning" at the 1st Hour, and at the others – the other one specific to the Hour) with two verses and with the bending of knees at each of the three singings of the troparion, then Glory, Both now: Theotokion ("What shall we call thee" at the 1st, and at the others – the other, specific to the Hour).
4.	Selected verses from the Holy Scripture of the Old Testament, that is: at the 1st Hour – "Direct my steps", at the 3rd – "Blessed is the Lord God", at the 6th Hour – "Let thy compassions come quickly", at the 9th – "Forsake us not". At the 1st Hour "Direct my steps" is divided into 4 verses, of which we sing the first 3 twice, and the 4th – three times. At the 6th Hour between the Theotokion and the Old Testament verses we sing the Troparion of the Prophecy of the Triodion and one prophecy between two Prokeimena there.
5.	After the Trisagion, instead of the Kondakion, we read three Lenten troparia, according to the order of the Hours in the Horologion, adding to the 2nd "Glory", and to the 3rd – "Both now".
6.	"Lord, have mercy" (40), "Thou Who at all times" and the rest with the prayer of St. Ephrem and with 16 usual prostrations.
7.	Trisagion with 3 prostrations, and after "Our Father" – the exclamation "For Thine is the Kingdom" and "Lord, have mercy" (12).
8.	Final prayer of the Hour and "Glory to Thee, O Christ God", dismissal of the weekday with the commemoration of the saint at the 1st Hour, and at the other Hours, since they are combined with the Typika, there will be no dismissal, but it will be at the end of the Typika.
Notes
1.	In the archcathedral temple the Hours 3rd, 6th, 9th, Typika and Vespers are celebrated together, beginning at 11 o'clock in the morning, and in the afternoon, at the usual time of Vespers, – Great Compline .
2.	The last prayer of the 9th Hour "O Master Lord Jesus Christ" is transferred to the Typika, to the place of the prayer "O All-holy Trinity", and the prayer "O All-holy Trinity" with the psalm following it is transferred, according to the rubric of our Pochayiv Triodion, to the end of Vespers . And on Wednesday and Friday, since Vespers will be with the Presanctified, "O All-holy Trinity" cannot be transferred to the end of Vespers, for it ends with the Liturgy and therefore remains in its place at the Typika, exactly so the prayer "O Master Lord Jesus Christ" remains in its place at the 9th Hour.
 
AT THE TYPIKA (OBIDNYTSIA)
Note: The first part of the Typika, from the beginning to the Beatitudes, falls out in Great Lent, and the last, from "O All-holy Trinity", is transferred to the end of Vespers. In the middle part the stichera on the Beatitudes and the Epistle and Gospel fall out.
RUBRIC
1.	"The Beatitudes", that is "Remember us, O Lord", "Blessed are the poor in spirit" and all other verses, then "Glory, Both now". After this both choirs, having come together, with uncovered heads, sing in a higher voice:
"Remember us, O Lord, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom".
And a great prostration.
"Remember us, O Master, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom".
And a great prostration.

VESPERS ON WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY WITH PRESANCTIFIED
Note on Prostrations
On Wednesday we make 3 small prostrations: at the Trisagion at the beginning, at "O come, let us worship", at "Alleluia" after the pre-introductory psalm and after each antiphon of the Kathisma and at "Let my prayer be set forth". Great prostrations, according to local custom, we make at "Light of Christ", when the priest blesses the people crosswise with the triple-candle; at the conclusion of the singing "Let my prayer be set forth" and after "Now the Powers of Heaven", when the consecrated Lamb is taken from the artophorion and placed on the diskos . And on Fridays at Vespers and at Compline we do not make prostrations, only the prescribed ones at the Presanctified, that is: after "Let my prayer be set forth" – 3 prostrations, after the Entrance of the Holy Gifts – 3 prostrations and at "Let my prayer be set forth" – 3 prostrations , and among us also at "Light of Christ" – 3 prostrations.

(On Friday evening stichera: Idiomelon of the Triodion twice, Martyria of the Octoechos of the current tone – 4  and of the Saint – 4, Glory: of the saint, if there is one, Both now: 1st Theotokion of the departing tone; if not, then Glory, Both now: the same Theotokion).
5.	Entrance with the Censer (on the Finding of the Precious Head of the Forerunner, on the 40 Martyrs and on Great Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday entrance – with the Gospel).
6.	At "O Gladsome Light" – Prokeimenon of the Triodion, one reading of the Triodion and the second Prokeimenon of the Triodion ; then the priest, having taken the triple-candle with the censer and exclaiming "Wisdom, Aright", begins "The Light of Christ", blessing with the triple-candle crosswise to the east, then, blessing to the west, says: "Illumines all" ; all make three prostrations to the ground, and the reader sings: "The Reading from Proverbs" and, when the priest or deacon exclaims: "Let us attend", reads the second reading of the Triodion.
7.	"Let my prayer be set forth". Has after it three verses and is sung six times, that is: twice – before the first verse, once – after each verse and again once at the end. And among us the first time "Let my prayer be set forth" is sung by the priest, the second time – by the choir, all three verses – by the priest, after each the choir – "Let my prayer be set forth", the last time in a higher voice up to the half – the priest, and from the half – the choir. Where there are two choirs, they sing "Let my prayer be set forth" alternately: the first begins after the priest, and the second half is sung by both choirs together. When the priest sings, he himself stands, and the choir and people kneel; when the choir sings, the choir stands together with the people, and the priest kneels. If there are two choirs, the one singing stands, and the other kneels; people who are on the side of the right choir kneel, stand and sing with the right choir, and those on the left – with the left .
The priest sings "Let my prayer be set forth" first in front of the altar, then the 1st verse – on the south, the 2nd – on the west, the 3rd – on the north side, and at the end the first half – again in front of the holy table . He censes each side of the altar twice, that is before the beginning of his singing and at the end of the choir's singing, that is at "The lifting up of my hands", for then, having censed, he moves to the next side of the altar, in order to cense there also, so that the choir is ready to sing its verse .

2.	If on this day falls a saint with Polyeleos, namely the Finding of the Precious Head of the Forerunner and the 40 Martyrs, and also on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of Passion Week, then immediately after "Let my prayer be set forth" there will be censing and on the two previously named feasts their Epistle and Gospel are read, the Gospel – beginning from "Wisdom, Aright". On the three days of Passion Week only the Gospel is read, beginning from "And that we may be accounted worthy", since there is no Epistle.
3.	By the decision of the Synod of Lviv, the pastor must celebrate the Liturgy of the Presanctified on every Wednesday and every Friday of Great Lent and on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of Passion Week .
Note on the number of prostrations per day. The number of prostrations made in church reached once 300 per day, excluding the Midnight Office: "Three hundred during the day and night, without the Midnight Office". (Greek Triodion, our Manuscript Typikon and Tserkovne Oko on the 1st Monday of Lent).
 
FIRST SATURDAY OF GREAT LENT
Memory of the Holy Great Martyr Theodore the Tyro 
On Friday evening
AT VESPERS WITH PRESANCTIFIED: Everything according to the general rubric, here on page 349.
AT COMPLINE
Note
Compline on all Fridays of Great Lent, according to the Greek rubric, is Small, and according to the Pochayiv Triodion, Tserkovne Oko and the Moscow Typikon – Great. However, in our times, when abbreviations prevail, we should adhere to the Greek rubric, the more so because even in our Horologia, in the order of Great Compline, troparia are given only for 4 days of the week, that is for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. We do not make prostrations, as was already said on page 349.
RUBRIC

The Greek Triodion adds: "we do so on all Friday evenings of holy and Great Lent". Before the Canon for the Dead we should sing also the usual Theotokion Canon of the Octoechos, for the rubric does not exclude it .

OF THE SECOND WEEK OF GREAT LENT
Everything – according to the rubric for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the 1st week of Great Lent, here on page 347 and following.
Note
Let it be known that from this Monday of the 2nd week of Lent the canons of the saints in the Menaion, which fall from the Saturday of Lazarus to the Sunday of Ap. Thomas, are sung at Compline with the Theotokion Canons. First the Canon of the Theotokos is sung, and after it – the Canon of the Menaion. After the 3rd Ode – Kondakion and Sessional Hymn of the Menaion, and after the 6th – Sessional Hymn of the Theotokos; after the canon – Stichera of the Menaion (Triodion of this day).
 
SATURDAY OF THE SECOND WEEK OF GREAT LENT
Note
The service of this Saturday, as also the services of the 3rd and 4th Saturdays of Great Lent, differ from the services of Meatfare Saturday and the Saturday before the Sunday of Pentecost in that it does not exclude fully either the service of the Menaion, or the service of the day of the Octoechos, that is to all saints and the dead. The services of Meatfare Saturday and the Saturday before the Sunday of Pentecost exclude generally the service of the Menaion, and from the service of the Octoechos little is taken, but have their own order in the Triodion exclusively for the dead. Therefore, we suppose that the two litanies for the dead: "In peace let us pray to the Lord" and "Have mercy on us, O God", which according to our later rubric are given at Vespers and at Matins, and the litany for the dead "Again and again", which is said between the odes of the canon, should be taken only on these two Saturdays which are exclusively for the dead, and on the other three – usual litanies.

According to this Typikon, the service of St. Mary of Egypt is sung on the fifth  Sunday of Lent, but if someone wishes, he may sing it instead of the service of the regular saint.
 
MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY OF THE FIFTH WEEK OF GREAT LENT
Everything – according to the general Lenten rubric of past weeks.
Thursday of the fifth week of Great Lent
on which we sing the Great Canon
The service of the regular saint is transferred to another day.
ON WEDNESDAY EVENING
AT VESPERS WITH PRESANCTIFIED
Everything – according to the Lenten rubric, as usual, except the stichera on "Lord, I have cried", which are taken 28 on 29, for the first Idiomelon is repeated, also one more at "Glory" and one at "Both now".
Refrains to the first 20 stichera we take from "Lord, I have cried", beginning from "Fall into their own nets"; to the 21st and 22nd stichera we refrain two usual verses from the Aposticha of Vespers; and to the other seven – "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee".
Notes
1.	The stichera, not only the two first, but also all others, we sing in the tone of the Idiomela, for of the three types of Prosomoia given in the Triodion at the other stichera, two in our Heirmologia we do not find; and the one which is given at the stichera of St. Andrew of Crete, although it is given also in the Heirmologia, nevertheless, today we do not use. The stichera of St. Andrew of Crete, in the Greek text are given according to the order and in the sequence of the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet.
2.	If there be no Presanctified, then the Idiomelon and Martyricon stichera on "Lord, I have cried" are not taken, but are transferred with their two refrains to the Aposticha.
3.	It is not good to neglect prostrations at the stichera of St. Andrew.
4.	At the entire divine service of this day we use sacred vestments of Lenten colors, as usual.
AT COMPLINE: We sing Small, without prostrations. After "It is truly meet" – Kondakion of the Great Canon.
MIDNIGHT OFFICE: Without prostrations. After the 1st Trisagion – usual troparia, after the 2nd – Kondakion of the Great Canon.
AT MATINS
1.	From the beginning to the end of the Sessional Hymns of the Octoechos, given at the end of the Triodion, at the 1st Kathisma, we sing everything according to the general Lenten rubric, then Psalm 50 and immediately, having omitted the litany "Save, O God", the Great Canon . At the time of the singing of the canon the holy doors are opened and candles are lit on the holy table. Before the holy doors in cathedral churches a rug is spread, on which first the bishop, if he be present, and then the other sacred ministers two by two, according to the rank of their dignity, at each ode make one great prostration, after the singing of each troparion of the ode of the canon. In our seminary, the seminarians make prostrations before the holy doors, and in the sanctuary, before the steps of the altar, all eight superiors make prostrations according to the rank of their dignity, one at one ode, by turn, and at the 9th Ode – all eight together, in epitrachelia.
2.	Canons two: one – the Great [Canon] of St. Andrew, of nine odes, the second – triodion, contains the 4th, 8th and 9th Odes, which also in these odes takes the first place. The odes of the nine-ode canon do not have an equal number of troparia and each of them has at the end two troparia to St. Mary of Egypt and one to St. Andrew of Crete. The triodion we sing on 10 troparia with the first heirmos, for the 2nd heirmos is not sung. Refrains to the troparia of the Great Canon are these: "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", then "Venerable Father Andrew, pray to God for us", then "Venerable Mother Mary, pray to God for us". To the troparia of the triodion the refrain will be – "Holy Apostles, pray to God for us" , because according to content they belong to the service of Thursday. At each troparion of the Canon of St. Andrew the rubrics prescribe three prostrations, but we make only one, however, great, and in cathedral temples the clergy makes prostrations only by turn and adapted to the nine odes of the canon. The choirs sing the canon in the middle of the church, each at a separate analogion, making at the troparia of the canon a small prostration. As Katavasia at all odes we take the heirmos of the last canon .
After the 3rd Ode – Sessional Hymn of the Triodion, after the 6th – Kondakion and Ikos of the Triodion with the Beatitudes; after the 9th – Trinity Sessional Hymn, all this – with the usual litanies. At the 9th Ode we sing "More honorable", as the Moscow and the new Constantinopolitan Typika also have. After the Canon – "It is truly meet" .
3.	Everything else, from the Praises psalms to the end of Matins, is taken according to the general Lenten rubric, only, if we do not add the 1st Hour, then after the 16 final prostrations at the prayer of St. Ephrem we recite the Trisagion with "Our Father" and "Lord, have mercy" (12), and then the priest: "Glory to Thee, O Christ God" and dismissal.
AT THE HOURS
Everything – according to the usual Lenten rubric, however, after the Trisagion we recite at all Hours only the one Kondakion of the Canon, and the 1st Hour – without Kathisma.
AT THE TYPIKA AND AT VESPERS: Everything – according to the usual Lenten rubric.
LITURGY
According to the rubric there should be the Presanctified, however, now we do not sing it during Great Lent, with the exception of Wednesdays and Fridays. In the archcathedral church on this day only read liturgies are celebrated.
 
FIFTH SATURDAY OF GREAT LENT – OF THE AKATHIST 
Note
The service of this feast is of the small type; it has only the Katavasia at Matins after each ode and the Great Doxology and is combined with the usual service of Lenten Saturday and with the Temple Canon at Matins. The peculiarity of this feast lies in that at its Matins the whole order of the Akathist to the Most Pure Virgin Mary is sung, the 12 ikos-kondakia of which are divided into four quarters, the first of which is sung instead of the Sessional Hymn after the first Kathisma, the second – instead of the Sessional Hymn – after the second Kathisma, the third – after the 3rd, and the fourth – after the 6th Ode of the Canon; the initial Kondakion is sung at the beginning and at the end of each quarter, and before the last singing of it – once more the first Ikos . This Matins, according to the rubric, is sung at the 4th hour of the night, but we sing it at the usual time . The service of the regular saint, according to the rubric of the Greek Triodion, is sung at Compline.
RUBRIC
AT VESPERS WITH PRESANCTIFIED
1.	Kathisma usual.
2.	On "Lord, I have cried" – stichera on 10: Idiomelon of the day twice, one Martyric and of the feast on 7, Glory, Both now: of the feast.
3.	At "O Gladsome Light" – Prokeimenon of the Triodion and reading, second Prokeimenon of the Triodion and reading and the rest of the Presanctified.
SMALL COMPLINE: After "It is truly meet" – Kondakion of the feast only.
MIDNIGHT OFFICE – Saturday.
AT MATINS
1.	On "God is the Lord": Troparion of the feast twice; Glory, Both now: once more.
2.	After the 1st Kathisma – small litany and the initial Kondakion "To the Directress" is sung by the choir. The priest, dressed in all sacred vestments of light color, opens the holy doors and censes everything as usual; then, having come to the altar, sings the first quarter of the ikos-kondakia and, after its conclusion, the same choir sings once more the initial Kondakion "To the Directress". All rubrics at this singing prescribe standing; (and therefore this is called Akathist, that is non-sitting). The choir sings the Kondakion in the middle of the church majestically and solemnly.
3.	After the 2nd Kathisma and after the 3rd and 6th Odes of the Canon, immediately after the small litany, the priest sings the other three quarters of the ikos-kondakia, and the choir – the Kondakion "To the Directress" at the beginning and at the end of each quarter. At the beginning of each quarter the priest censes everything just as at the beginning of the first quarter .
This Akathist order is celebrated usually at the altar. In the cathedral temple it is sung at the altar of the Mother of God, which is located in its right nave; and then the priest censes the altar and everything else, as usual, and immediately, having left the holy doors open, goes out through them to the altar of the Most Holy Theotokos and sings there the Akathist order, censing from the altar at the beginning of each quarter the icon of the Mother of God, the sacred ministers, the choirs and the people. After singing the 4th quarter of the ikos-kondakia the priest returns to the sanctuary, closes the holy doors and goes to the sacristy, where he takes off the sacred vestments and, having put on the epitrachelion, continues the service of Matins.
4.	Canons 2 [making] 12: Temple of the Saint with heirmos on 6 and of the feast on 6. Katavasia "I shall open my mouth" up to the 6th Ode. From the 6th Ode we do not take the Canon of the Temple, but we sing 3 canons on 14, that is of the feast on 6 and both canons of the triodion on 8 with the addition of two troparia, that is one Martyric with the refrain "Wondrous is God", and the second – for the dead, with the refrain "Their souls", and the Katavasia of the Triodion. Refrain to the troparia of the Canon of the Theotokos – the general "Most Holy Theotokos, save us", however, among us they like to refrain the acrostic of the canon "Container of Joy, to thee alone it is fitting to rejoice". In Greek: "Vessel of joy, to thee alone it is fitting to rejoice". Both the troparia and this refrain we sing to the melody given in the new Heirmologion on the Akathist Saturday.
After the 3rd Ode, after the last singing of the Kondakion "To the Directress", we recite the SESSIONAL HYMN of the feast; after the 6th, immediately after the small litany, is sung the last quarter of the ikos-kondakia with the Kondakion "To the Directress" before the beginning and after the conclusion, however, its last Kondakion "O All-praised Mother" is sung three times, after this – the 1st Ikos and then – "To the Directress". At the 9th Ode we sing "More honorable" and after the 9th – Exaposteilarion of the feast.
5.	Stichera of the Praises – 4: all – of the feast, Glory, Both now: of the feast.
6.	After the Great Doxology – Troparion of the feast.

Everything – according to the general rubric of a feast of the Lord with All-Night Vigil without Litiya. It has everything proper to itself, and at the Liturgy – Antiphons and Entrance Hymn. However, before the Troparion of Flowery [Sunday] we sing yesterday's Troparion of Lazarus; only after the Great Doxology we sing the Troparion of Lazarus alone.
AT GREAT VESPERS: On "Lord, I have cried" – stichera on 10; and at the blessing of loaves – Troparion of Lazarus twice and of Flowery [Sunday] – once.
AT GREAT MATINS
1.	On "God is the Lord": Troparion of Lazarus twice, Glory, Both now: of Flowery [Sunday].
2.	The blessing and distribution of branches takes place, according to the rubric, immediately after the 50th Psalm, during the kissing of the Gospel. According to our custom, the blessing takes place after the 50th Psalm, and the distribution – during the anointing with oil (myrovanie), that is during the canon. And it takes place thus: When the priest has sung the Gospel, he places it on the analogion near the tetrapod, between two candles lit on candlesticks. On the tetrapod are placed branches and prepared censers and sprinklers. The priest approaches the tetrapod and at the time when the choir reads the 50th Psalm, having put incense in and blessed the censer, censes the branches from the four sides of the tetrapod and, after the conclusion of the 50th Psalm, when the deacon exclaims (if there be none, then the priest himself) "Let us pray to the Lord", reads aloud (from the Service Book or from the Triodion ) the first prayer "O Lord our God", and the choir responds: "Amen". Priest: "Peace be to all"; deacon: "Bow your heads unto the Lord"; and, after "To Thee, O Lord", the priest reads the second prayer "O Lord God Almighty ... unto ages of ages" ; choir: "Amen"; the priest sprinkles the branches with holy water, saying: "These branches are blessed and sanctified" and the rest; and, after singing the litany "Save, O God", with his right hand anoints the people, and with his left hand distributes to all the branches, which the deacon solemnly hands to him, and if there be no deacon, then one of the church servers .
After the 9th Ode we do not read the Exaposteilarion, but immediately: "Holy is the Lord our God" (3) in Tone 4.
AT THE LITURGY: After the Entrance – Troparion of Lazarus, Glory: of FLOWERY [SUNDAY], Both now: Kondakion of FLOWERY [SUNDAY]. We sing the Trisagion.

We make the Entrance with the Gospel and, after the second reading of the Triodion, we sing the Gospel, as above, and everything else with prostrations, according to the Lenten custom.

On Monday and Tuesday evening – Great Compline with prostrations according to the Lenten rubric, and at it also – the triodion of the Triodion and after the Trisagion – Kondakion of the Triodion, then "O Lord of Hosts, be with us" .

Before the Kondakion-Ikos the priest sings the small litany; at the 9th Ode we do not sing "More honorable", nor "It is truly meet" after the canon, but immediately after the Katavasia – small litany and Exaposteilarion "Thy bridal chamber" twice, Glory, Both now: three times the same.

AT THE HOURS
Everything – according to the general Lenten rubric of Great Lent, only:
1.	At the 1st and 9th Hours there will be no Kathisma, but it will be only at the 3rd and 6th.
2.	Immediately after the Theotokion "O Theotokos, thou art the vine" at the 3rd Hour and, after the corresponding Theotokia, at the other two Hours, the rubrics prescribe the reading of the Four Gospels, which today among us is read only in cathedral, or conciliar, churches . At the 6th Hour we read the Gospel not immediately after the Theotokion, but after the conclusion of the Troparion of the Prophecy and the Paremia with its Prokeimena. The reading of the Four Gospels covers all the Evangelists, that is Matthew, Mark and Luke in full, and John – only up to the "Passion of Christ", that is up to "Now is the Son of man glorified", Section 46, verse 13.32. All the Evangelists, taken together, are divided into 9 readings, according to the number of the three Hours (3, 6, 9) and three days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Matthew is divided into 2 readings, Mark – into 2, John – into 2, and Luke – into 3. The first reading covers the first half of Matthew, the second – the second half of Matthew, the third – the first half of Mark, the fourth – the second half of Mark, the fifth – the first part of Luke, the sixth – the second part of Luke, the seventh – the third part of Luke, the eighth – the first half of John, the ninth – the second half of John. The rubric does not indicate where the first half of the three Evangelists and the first and second parts of Luke end. But since Matthew has 28 chapters, its half ends with the 14th chapter, Mark – 16 chapters, so its half ends with the 8th chapter, Luke – 24 chapters, so its first part ends with the 8th chapter, and the second – with the 16th. John, up to "Now is [the Son of man] glorified", has 12 chapters and part of the 13th chapter, therefore its half ends with the 6th chapter and part of the 7th.
The priest, at the beginning of each reading, dressed in a phelonion of Lenten color, opens the holy doors and censes everything as usual, then, having come out through the holy doors to the analogion placed before the holy doors facing the people, on which stand two candlesticks with lit candles, reads from there the Gospel, beginning from "And that we may be accounted worthy". After the conclusion of each reading, having kissed the beginning of the reading and leaving the Gospel on the analogion until the end of the 3rd reading, he returns to the sanctuary and, having closed the holy doors, takes off the phelonion .
3.	After the Trisagion – Kondakion of the Triodion.
AT THE TYPIKA
1.	Only one Kondakion of the Triodion.
2.	In Slavonic rubrics and the Greek Typikon of Sabbas, on Great Wednesday, instead of the dismissal the prayer "O Master most merciful" is given, which is at Vespers with All-Night Vigil, and in Slavonic ones – also the prayer of forgiveness for sins committed in Great Lent, and commemorations. However, these superfluous additions of the Greco-Slavs are unknown to the Greeks. The prayer "O Master most merciful" and the forgiveness may be retained perhaps only in monasteries. The commemorations, which are superfluous here, will be taken later, at the end of Compline and the Midnight Office, which have nothing in common with forgiveness for the sins of the Forty Days.
On Wednesday
AT VESPERS WITH PRESANCTIFIED,
AT COMPLINE AND AT THE MIDNIGHT OFFICE
Everything – according to the rubric of Monday and Tuesday, here on pp. 379-380, only on Wednesday, after the dismissal of the Liturgy of the Presanctified, the prostrations in church cease, and in the cells are made until the ringing for Matins of the bright Resurrection of Christ . We, however, until the Resurrection of Christ make three great prostrations in church, at the end of the Divine Service, singing the verse "Though Thou didst suffer", and during the veneration of the Shroud, singing "The noble Joseph".
 
GREAT THURSDAY 
AT MATINS
1.	"Blessed is our God", "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", "O Heavenly King" and everything else, as usual, with the Two Psalms and with the Six Psalms up to the end of the litany "In peace let us pray to the Lord".
2.	Instead of "God is the Lord" we sing Alleluia in Tone 8, that is in the tone of the following troparion; but since this troparion has a specific melody in the Heirmologion, we sing Alleluia according to the pattern of its melody.
3.	Troparion "When the glorious disciples" twice, Glory, Both now: once more the same.
4.	There will be no Kathismata and Sessional Hymns, but immediately the Gospel from Luke, Section 108 and 1st verse of Section 109, that is the 39th verse of the 22nd chapter ; then Psalm 50 and, leaving out "Save, O God", we sing immediately the Canon.
5.	Canon only one: heirmoi – twice, troparia – on 6  with the refrain "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee". Katavasia after each ode – heirmos of the same canon once, both choirs together. After the 3rd Ode we recite the Sessional Hymn, after the 6th – Kondakion and Ikos, at the 9th we do not sing "More honorable" , nor after the 9th – "It is truly meet", but instead of this, – the heirmos of the canon  and immediately the Exaposteilarion twice, Glory, Both now: the same.

3.	After the Kondakion – "Lord, have mercy" (40), "O All-holy Trinity"  and dismissal.
Great Thursday evening
AT VESPERS WITH THE LITURGY OF ST. BASIL 
Note
"It is fitting for the priest on Great Thursday at the Liturgy to consecrate two Lambs, in order to consume one at Communion, and to place the other in the artophorion and keep in the tabernacle in the usual place until today (Friday)". Thus in our Service Book . Regarding the Lamb itself, which is to be kept in the tabernacle until the day of exposition, the Synod of Lviv orders that "it before consecration be fitted to its vessel, the so-called Melchizedek, into which it is well inserted and carefully wiped, so that afterwards crumbs do not fall from it; so that placed in such a way in the Melchizedek, it be consecrated at the Liturgy of one of the preceding days and kept in the tabernacle until the exposition itself". When the priest prepares the Lamb at the Proskomedia, wishing to use it for exposition, he does not say over it the words "In remembrance of the Lord" etc., nor does he perform over it the sacred actions which are usually performed over the Lamb that is to be consumed at the same Divine Service, for it is considered only communicative; it is enough only to cut it, so that it would be convenient to break and consume it on another day.
RUBRIC
1.	From the beginning to "Lord, I have cried" everything – according to the rubric of the Eve of the Nativity of Christ, here on pp. 169-170.
2.	On "Lord, I have cried" – stichera on 10.
3.	Entrance with the Gospel and 3 readings of the Triodion, the two first – with their Prokeimena, and the third – without Prokeimenon. The Prokeimenon of the day from the Horologion is not taken.
4.	Immediately after the 3rd reading – small litany with the exclamation of the Trisagion, Trisagion, Prokeimenon of the Triodion, Epistle and Gospel and, according to the order, Liturgy of Basil the Great.
5.	Instead of the Cherubic Hymn, also after the transfer of the Holy Gifts, instead of the Communion Hymn and "Let our mouths be filled", we sing the Troparion "Of Thy Mystical Supper". So in general editions. In our Manuscript Typikon, our Service Books and the Moscow Typikon, instead of "In Thee rejoiceth", is prescribed the Heirmos of the 9th Ode of the Canon ("Come, let us the faithful"). The Euchologion of Benedict gives "Of Thy Mystical Supper" only instead of "In Thee rejoiceth". (In the order of the Liturgy of Basil).
AT SMALL COMPLINE: Triodion of the Triodion and, after the Trisagion, – Kondakion of Great Friday only.
AT THE DAILY MIDNIGHT OFFICE: Everything – as usual, in the cells.
 
GREAT FRIDAY
AT MATINS
THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY AND SAVING PASSION
OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
Notes
1.	We sing this Matins after sunset; according to the rubric – at the 2nd hour of the night.
2.	Before the holy doors is placed an analogion with two candlesticks, facing the people, and on it – the Gospel.
GENERAL OVERVIEW
From the usual beginning to the end of the troparion after "Alleluia" and from the Canon to the end of Matins everything – according to the rubric of Matins of Great Thursday, here on pp. 383-384. Between the troparion and the canon there will be five Sessional Hymns, each of which has before it three antiphons of the Passion troparia, without Kathismata and small litanies, then the Beatitudes, Prokeimenon and Psalm 50. Besides this we read 12 Passion Gospels: the first – after the troparion, the five following – after each of the five Sessional Hymns, the seventh – after the Beatitudes, the eighth – after the 50th Psalm, the ninth – after the Exaposteilarion, the tenth – after the Praises, the eleventh – after "Let us complete", the twelfth – after the Aposticha. After the singing of each Gospel we ring all the church bells and, after the twelfth Gospel, we do not ring until the Resurrection itself, but instead of bells we use wooden clappers. But it is better already at Passion Matins not to ring, but to strike clappers or boards, for Passion Matins is a time of sorrow, to which the joyful sounds of bells do not correspond. Also in Rome already at Passion Matins clappers are used.
DETAILED RUBRIC
1.	From the usual beginning to the end of the litany "In peace let us pray to the Lord" everything – as at Matins daily .
2.	Instead of "God is the Lord" we sing Alleluia in the tone of the following troparion.
3.	Troparion "When the glorious disciples" twice, Glory, Both now: once more the same.
4.	When the troparion is sung the third time, the priest vests in a violet phelonion, goes before the steps of the altar, bows to the Holy Mysteries and, having opened the holy doors, recites the prayer of the censer, after which, having blessed the censer: "Blessed is our God", censes around the holy table, then, having stood before the steps of the altar and bowed low, goes out through the holy doors before the iconostasis and censes the local icons, the choirs and the people and, having returned through the holy doors to the sanctuary, gives up the censer and, having again bowed low, sings the small litany without exclamation, then goes out through the holy doors to the analogion and exclaims: "And that we may be accounted worthy", "Peace be to all", "Wisdom, Aright" and the rest. The choir, instead of "Glory to Thee, O Lord", sings "Glory to Thy Passion, O Lord" . Priest: "Let us attend" and reads the first Gospel. After the conclusion of the reading the choir, instead of "Glory to Thee, O Lord", sings: "Glory to Thy long-suffering, O Lord" . The priest, having kissed the beginning of the reading, returns to the sanctuary and, having closed the holy doors and bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, goes to the sacristy, takes off the phelonion and goes to his place.
All this – exactly so at the readings of the other Gospels, with the exception of the litany and censing, which according to the rubric of our Triodia and the Typikon of the Lviv University, will be only at the 1st Gospel and at the five Sessional Hymns, and the censing – only of the holy table. They give thus: "We do not sit at these Sessional Hymns, since the priest censes the holy table, but we sing them standing" . Finally we consider that it is fitting to cense not only at the Sessional Hymns, but also at all other Gospels, for the censing takes place not for the sake of the Sessional Hymns, but for the sake of the Gospels, however, only the holy table (around), as our Triodia have, which mention the censing only of the holy table. Everything should be censed only twice, that is at the 1st Gospel and at the Canon, at the heirmos of the 9th Ode.
According to Slavonic rubrics the Abbot or Superior should sing the first Gospel, and according to others also the twelfth. In the cathedral temple the bishop reads them, others – the sacred ministers, according to the rank of their dignity .
If there be deacons, they remain from the beginning of Matins, dressed in dalmatic with orarion of violet color, in the sanctuary, at their places, until they begin to sing the third time the troparion "When the glorious disciples"; then they come out together with the priest who will sing the Gospel, dressed in a violet phelonion, before the steps of the altar and, having bowed together with him to the Holy Mysteries, open the holy doors, cense everything as usual, as at the beginning of the Liturgy, return before the steps of the altar and, having given up the censers and bowed both together to the Holy Mysteries, go out, each through his door, before the holy doors and, again having bowed to the Holy Mysteries, stand there until the second deacon after the singing of the troparion sings the small litany; then, having bowed to the Holy Mysteries and having exchanged their places, they proceed to the analogion so that, when the priest approaches the analogion, the first deacon is on the right, and the second – on the left of him. When the priest, having bowed to the Holy Mysteries, comes out through the holy doors to the analogion, the first deacon exclaims: "And that we may be accounted worthy". Priest: "Peace be to all". Second deacon: "Wisdom, Aright. Let us listen". Priest: "The Reading from (Name)". First deacon: "Let us attend". Priest – reading. After the conclusion of the reading, the priest kisses the beginning of the reading first himself, afterwards the deacon who is on the right kisses [it], and after him the one who is on the left. All three return to the sanctuary: the priest – through the central, and the deacons – through the side doors, stand together with the priest before the steps of the altar and, having closed the holy doors and bowed all together to the Holy Mysteries, go to their places. At the other Gospels, since there will be no small litany, the deacons, having come out before the holy doors, bow and, having exchanged places, proceed to the analogion and, when the priest stands between them, exclaim: "And that we may be accounted worthy" and the rest, as above.
If the bishop or other sacred ministers be present, the deacons should cense them before the choirs and neither the priest nor the deacons kiss the Gospel before the bishop and sacred ministers. And therefore both deacons together carry the open Gospel to the bishop and sacred ministers to kiss, then to the priest standing in the holy doors, and when he kisses it, then they also kiss [it] and place [it] on the analogion; then, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, return, each through his door, to the sanctuary.
5.	After the singing of the first Gospel follow five Sessional Hymns, each of which has before it three antiphons of the Passion troparia, and after itself – one Passion Gospel. The number of troparia in all antiphons is not the same and therefore, according to the rubric, each must be repeated , except the Theotokion, with which each antiphon concludes, with the refrain "Glory, Both now" .
6.	The Beatitudes, with the Prokeimenon and the 6th Gospel at the end. The number of stichera on the Beatitudes – 7, and with "Glory, Both now" – 9 .
7.	Psalm 50 and the eighth Gospel.
8.	Canon – triodion, heirmoi – twice, troparia – on 12, Katavasia after each ode – its heirmos, both choirs together. After the 5th Ode – small litany and Kondakion-Ikos; at the 9th Ode we do not sing "More honorable", but only the heirmos "More honorable" ; after the 9th we do not sing "It is truly meet", but we sing the Katavasia ; then – small litany and three times the Exaposteilarion with the refrain "Glory, Both now", as usual, then – the ninth Gospel.
9.	Stichera of the Praises on 4, Glory: one sticheron, Both now: another, then – the tenth Gospel.
10.	"To Thee belongs glory" , "Glory to Thee who hast shown us the light" and the Small Doxology.
11.	Litany "Let us complete" and, after the exclamation "For Thou art a merciful [God]" , immediately – the eleventh Gospel.
12.	Aposticha and the twelfth Gospel.
13.	"It is a good thing", Trisagion, "Our Father", Troparion of Friday "Thou hast redeemed".
14.	Litany "Have mercy on us, O God" and the specific dismissal of Great Friday, intermediate, that is Priest: "Wisdom", Choir: "More honorable"; Priest: "Glory to Thee, O Christ" and the rest, as usual . We do not combine with the 1st Hour.
ERECTION OF THE TOMB OF GOD
On Friday morning, before the beginning of the Royal Hours, the Shroud and the most beautiful Book of the Holy Gospels is placed on the holy table. Before the holy doors is placed the Tomb of God, at which, according to the custom of the northern and western Latin churches , the Holy Mysteries are exposed until the Resurrection of Christ itself. Our Service Books prescribe placing on this Tomb the Artophorion with the Holy Mysteries. According to the custom of our archcathedral temple, the Holy Mysteries are exposed in a monstrance on the main altar. And the Tomb of God should be erected so that above it rises a cross without the Crucified One, with a cloth hung on its crossbar and with the instruments of Christ's passion, it should be decorated with costly carpets, surrounded by many candlesticks and lamps and vessels with small trees and flowers. The front board of the sarcophagus is covered with red damask, to which a cloth is attached, and to it afterwards the Shroud will be attached. The board itself should not lie horizontally, but slanted so that the Shroud attached to it would be visible and accessible for veneration.
ROYAL HOURS
In the archcathedral church they are sung at 10 o'clock in the morning, together with the Typika and with Vespers . We sing everything according to the rubric of the Royal Hours of the Eve of the Nativity of Christ. However, since the Tomb of God is placed before the holy doors, the analogion of the Gospel is placed a little further from it, the analogia of other readings – further from it. And everything that on the Eve of the Nativity of Christ the sacred ministers recite before the holy doors, they now recite before the Tomb, but they do not cense the Tomb, since there is nothing in it yet.
TYPIKA (OBIDNYTSIA)
We join it to the 9th Hour, but we do not celebrate from the beginning, as on the Eve of the Nativity, but from the Beatitudes, without stichera, in this way:
1.	"The Beatitudes", "Glory, Both now"; "Remember us, O Lord" (3).
2.	"The choir of heavenly hosts" with verses, Both now: "I believe".
3.	"Remit, pardon", "Our Father", Kondakion of Great Friday.
4.	"Lord, have mercy" (12); priest: "O All-holy Trinity".
5.	"Blessed be the name of the Lord" (3), "I will bless the Lord".
6.	"It is truly meet" with "More honorable than the Cherubim".
7.	Priest: "Glory to Thee, O Christ God" and dismissal of Great Friday, to the people.
Today there is no Liturgy, unless the Annunciation falls, and immediately after the Typika we begin Vespers.
On Great Friday
AT VESPERS
Notes
1.	At this Vespers there will be an Entrance with the Gospel and, at its end, at the last sticheron of the Aposticha, – the procession with the Shroud and the placing of it in the Tomb .
2.	All actions that the sacred ministers at usual Vespers perform before the iconostasis, at this Vespers they perform before the Tomb of God.
RUBRIC
1.	From the usual beginning to "Lord, I have cried" everything – as at Daily Vespers, without Kathisma.
2.	On "Lord, I have cried" – stichera on 6, Glory: one sticheron, Both now: another. Entrance with the Gospel.
3.	Instead of the Prokeimenon of the day there will be Prokeimenon of the Triodion, Paremia and third Paremia; then – third Prokeimenon of the Apostle, Apostle, "Alleluia" and Gospel. At "Alleluia" there will be censing. "Let us attend. Peace be to all. Wisdom, let us attend" we exclaim only at the 1st and 3rd Prokeimena. We begin the Gospel from "Wisdom, Aright". Instead of "Glory to Thee, O Lord" before the Gospel will be "Glory to Thy Passion, O Lord", and after the Gospel – "Glory to Thy long-suffering, O Lord", exactly so as at Matins.
4.	"Let us all say", "Vouchsafe", "Let us complete" and Aposticha.
5.	At the last sticheron of the Aposticha, that is at "Thee, who art clothed with light", takes place the procession with the Shroud and the placing of it in the Tomb. According to the custom of our cathedral churches this takes place in the following way: During the singing of the Aposticha the procession is formed in the church. On the altar, on the left side, stands the monstrance, candles are lit on the altar and at the Tomb.
The sacred ministers, the bishop and the four most worthy canons, who will carry the Shroud, vest in all sacred vestments of their rank, and the other canons and priests – only in epitrachelia and phelonia, some – only in epitrachelia, and two deacons – in all diaconal [vestments]. Lit candles are distributed to the canons and other priests in the sanctuary, and to the brotherhood – in the church. The sacred ministers approach the steps of the altar and bow low. The bishop ascends to the altar, takes the Shroud, spread on the altar, and gives it to the four canons so that each holds it by one corner. Then the deacon who is on the right ascends to the altar and, having bowed low, unlocks the artophorion, takes from there the pyx with the Holy Mysteries, places [it] on the (folded) antimension, takes from there the Lamb with the stand into which it is inserted, not touching it with his fingers, but holding by the stand, places [it] into the monstrance and locks it well. Having locked the pyx, he places [it] into the artophorion and, having bowed, locks it also; and places the monstrance on the antimension so that it faces the people, steps aside until the bishop, kneeling, censes the Holy Mysteries three times, each time – with a prostration at the end, and, having taken upon himself the omophorion (aer), approaches the altar. Then the deacon, having bowed to the Holy Mysteries, takes with both hands the monstrance and hands it to the bishop, who before that makes a prostration. The bishop turns to the right to the people, and when the singers begin to sing "Thee, who art clothed with light", goes out behind the clergy through the holy doors on the northern side of the Tomb into the church and, having entered under the canopy, surrounded by candle-bearers and preceded by two deacons who cense unceasingly, proceeds behind all to the church doors. In front goes the cross-bearer, then the banner-bearers, four girls icon-bearers, after them – the church brotherhood, the seminarians, the seminary choir, then, from the holy doors, – priests, canons, four sacred dignitaries who carry the Shroud, turned with feet to the people, and at the end – the bishop with deacons who cense, and candle-bearers. The procession goes out of the church and turns to the right, that is to its northern side and, having gone around the church three times (or, as now they do there, – once), returns to the church. Those who carry the Shroud, and the other priests stand before the Tomb, and the bishop with the deacons returns by the southern side of the Tomb, through the holy doors, to the sanctuary. The right deacon receives from his hands the Holy Mysteries and places [them] on the altar. The bishop kneels and, having put aside the omophorion (Velum), censes the Holy Mysteries three times, each time bowing his head; the deacon, having bowed, exposes the Holy Mysteries at the top of the tabernacle. Having bowed before the steps of the altar, all three depart: the bishop through the central, the deacons – through the side doors before the Tomb. The bishop receives the Shroud from the canons who hold it, and places [it] on the Tomb, and they fasten it to the Tomb. When the singers have finished singing "Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart", the Trisagion and the rest with "Our Father", the bishop exclaims: "For Thine is the Kingdom" and begins to sing with the servers the troparion "The noble Joseph"; at the end he makes with the servers a low bow, and all the people – a great prostration to the ground. Then the second time the same troparion – the second choir, and all – a prostration, as before. And where there will be only one choir, the first time the troparion is sung by the sacred ministers, the second time – by the choir, the third time the half – by the sacred ministers, and from "wrapped [it]" and further – by the choir . After the singing of the troparion and after the prostrations all kiss the Shroud, according to the order, having made before the kissing one prostration: first the bishop, and after him – all other sacred ministers, according to the rank of their dignity. After this there will be the Great Dismissal, specific to this Saturday, after which the sacred ministers return to the sanctuary, leaving the holy doors open until the end of Bright Week, take off the sacred vestments and go out, and the people kiss the Shroud .
Notes
1.	Where there will be only one priest, let him choose for himself four most honorable laymen to carry the Shroud.
2.	If the pastor has several churches, then in the mother [church] he sings Vespers with the bringing out of the Shroud, and in the filial ones – only brings out the Shroud thus: after "Blessed is our God" and "O come, let us worship" (3) immediately – procession with "Thee, who art clothed with light" and, after the procession, – "Glory to Thee, O Christ God", dismissal and "The noble Joseph" (3) with prostrations.
SMALL COMPLINE
This Compline, as also the Midnight Office, we read in private. At Compline – the Canon on the Crucifixion of the Lord and on the Lamentation of the Most Holy Theotokos.
After "It is truly meet" – Kondakion of Great Saturday.
SATURDAY MIDNIGHT OFFICE: Everything – as usual.
MATINS OF GREAT SATURDAY
Notes
1.	This Matins we sing usually on Friday evening, after sunset, although the rubrics prescribe it at the 7th hour of the night.
2.	The sacred ministers remain during Matins before the Tomb of God, where seats and a table with candlesticks and books are prepared for them. Sitting, they sing Matins from there: the priests – in epitrachelia and phelonia, and the deacons – in dalmatics of violet color.
RUBRIC
1.	From "Blessed is our God" to "O come, let us worship" exclusively everything – as usual at Matins; then after "Lord, have mercy" (12), without "O come, let us worship" the priest immediately: "Glory to the Holy" and the Six Psalms up to "God is the Lord", as usual .
2.	On "God is the Lord" – Troparion "The noble Joseph" (2), Glory: "When Thou didst descend", Both now: "The angel stood by the tomb" .
3.	17th Kathisma ("The Blameless") in three stations with the Encomia (Praises), with censing at the beginning of each station and a small litany after each station.
Regarding the censing, we suppose that it is sufficient to cense only the Shroud (together with the Holy Mysteries, if they be exposed on the tomb), the choirs and the people .
About the Encomia (Praises), in Greek Triodia called Engkomia (praise), let it be known that before each of them one verse of the Kathisma is sung, until all are finished; only the first troparion of each station (in the editions of Pochayiv Triodia also the second troparion of the second station) is sung without a verse both at the beginning and at the end of each station, with the exception of the third, after which the first troparion is not sung and the small litany is not recited, but immediately – "The choir of angels" and, after the singing of it, – small litany.
4.	After "The choir of angels" with the small litany – Sessional Hymn, 50th Psalm and Canon.
5.	Canon: heirmoi – twice, troparia – on 12. Refrain – "Glory to Thee, O Lord, for Thy holy burial". Katavasia, heirmos of the canon, – both choirs together.
After the 3rd Ode – Sessional Hymn, after the 6th – Kondakion-Ikos, at the 9th we do not sing "More honorable"  and after the 9th we do not recite "It is truly meet", but the heirmos; and afterwards, instead of the Exaposteilarion, we sing "Holy is the Lord our God" (3).
6.	4 Stichera of the Praises, then one at "Glory" and one at "Both now".
7.	At the Great Doxology we make the Entrance with the Gospel and, instead of the one troparion after the Doxology, there will be one Sticheron of the Praises (Epitaphios), two troparia and three readings, that is one – of the Prophecy, one – of the Apostle and one – of the Gospel.
The Entrance takes place thus: During the singing of the Stichera of the Praises the priest and deacons, if there be any, having bowed low before the Shroud, and simultaneously also before the Holy Mysteries, go to the sacristy and vest in all sacred vestments of their rank. During the singing of the Doxastikon also the other sacred ministers, who are before the Tomb of God, dressed in phelonia, having bowed low, depart to the sanctuary and, when the priest with the deacons comes before the steps of the altar, stand together with him on both sides and bow all together to the Holy Mysteries. After singing the Praises [Stichera] the priest exclaims: "Glory to Thee who hast shown us the light", then puts incense in for the left deacon and, when the Doxology ends, approaches the altar, takes from it the Gospel, gives it to the right deacon and, preceded by candle-bearers and the deacon with the censer, they make the Entrance just as at the Liturgy. Having stood before the Tomb of God: the right deacon – on the right, and the left – on the left of the priest, closer to the Tomb, the other sacred ministers – on two wings, a little at a distance, await the conclusion of the Trisagion and the sticheron "Come, let us bless". After the conclusion of the singing of the sticheron the first deacon, raising the orarion in the direction of the people, exclaims: "Let us attend", the priest, blessing the people: "Peace be to all", the second deacon, raising the orarion: "Wisdom, let us attend" and we sing the Troparion "The noble Joseph" once. The first deacon places the Gospel on the analogion facing the people, the second gives up the censer and the Troparion of the Prophecy once .
Then again: "Let us attend. Peace be to all. Wisdom, let us attend", Prokeimenon, Reading of the Prophecy, Second Prokeimenon, Reading of the Apostle and "Alleluia", during which the deacons cense the Tomb of God, the present sacred ministers and the people. After this the first deacon: "Wisdom, Aright! Let us listen"; Priest: "The Reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew". Choir: "Glory to Thy Passion, O Lord". Second deacon: "Let us attend"; the priest sings the Gospel, facing the people. After its conclusion the choir: "Glory to Thy long-suffering, O Lord". Then the priest, having kissed and closed the Gospel, leaves it on the analogion, and the first deacon sings the litany "Let us all say", and the second – "Let us complete our prayer" in full, as usual.
8.	After the dismissal we sing the Troparion "The noble Joseph" (3) with prostrations exactly as at Vespers. The deacon takes the Gospel from the analogion, the sacred ministers depart to the sanctuary and take off the sacred vestments, the deacon places the Gospel on the altar and, having bowed, departs and unvests.
AT THE HOURS
1.	At all: Troparion and Kondakion of Great Saturday.
2.	Dismissal of Matins of Great Saturday.
AT THE TYPIKA: Exactly as on Great Thursday, here on page 385; however, the Greek Triodion does not give the Typika.
On Great Saturday evening
AT VESPERS WITH THE LITURGY OF ST. BASIL
1.	According to the custom of the archcathedral church, this Vespers begins at 9 o'clock in the day .
2.	On this day there will be only one Vespers, that is Great with the Liturgy of St. Basil and without All-Night Vigil, and after the Prayer behind the Ambo, or (as the rubrics prescribe) after the dismissal of the Liturgy, there will be the Blessing of Loaves, as usual at the All-Night Vigil.
3.	The form and rubric of this Vespers is the same as the Vespers on the Eve of the Nativity, here on pp. 169-171, without "Blessed is the man"; only here, after "O Gladsome Light", there will be no Prokeimenon, but immediately 15 readings, between which there will be no troparia, and at the 6th reading all verses of the Song of Moses are read with the refrain "For gloriously has He been glorified", and at the 15th reading the verses of the Song of the Three Youths are read with the refrain "Praise the Lord and exalt Him above all for ever". Instead of "Alleluia" we sing the last verse of the 81st Psalm with its other verses, in the form of a Prokeimenon . Dismissal of Matins of Saturday.
4.	Although the service of the feast usually begins at Vespers of the preceding day and therefore the whole Resurrection service should be celebrated in bright vestments, nevertheless, since the Liturgy, with which Vespers is sung, is still of the Saturday day, in the part of the verses on "Lord, I have cried" we sing about the descent of the Savior's soul into hell and therefore from the beginning of Vespers we use violet vestments, and afterwards change them after the conclusion of the Apostle, at the verses instead of "Alleluia", in order to read the Gospel already in bright vestments .
5.	Throughout the whole Bright Week, beginning from the Vespers of this day, the Resurrection service is sung and, besides the stichera of the Triodion, are sung also the Resurrection stichera of the Octoechos, each day – in a different tone, that is on Sunday – in Tone 1, on Monday – in Tone 2, on Tuesday – in Tone 3, on Wednesday – in Tone 4, on Thursday – in Tone 5, on Friday – in Tone 6, on Saturday – in Tone 8, omitting Tone 7.
AT COMPLINE
In Greek and Slavonic Triodia, except ours, Compline is not given, but from the Blessing of Loaves to the Tomb Order, which is sung immediately before Resurrection Matins, the reading of the whole book of the "Acts of the Apostles" is prescribed, although among us today these "Acts" are sung perhaps only in cathedral and seminary temples; and they are sung by verses by clerics two by two, alternately.
This Compline should be Small. Finally, even our Triodion leaves the choice to read it or not, for it is written about it: "if there be". In any case, in our Triodion is given the Canon on the Burial of Christ and on the Lamentation of the Most Holy Theotokos. After the 9th Ode, instead of "It is truly meet", will be the heirmos of this ode and, after the Trisagion, – Kondakion of Great Saturday.
INSTEAD OF THE MIDNIGHT OFFICE 
Note: We sing it before the Shroud, immediately before Resurrection Matins either only in epitrachelion and phelonion, as usual in the provinces, or in all sacred vestments of violet color, as in cathedral churches.
RUBRIC
1.	From the usual beginning to "O come, let us worship" we celebrate everything, as usual at the Midnight Office; and immediately Psalm 50 and Canon.
2.	The Tomb Canon of Matins of Great Saturday "He who in ancient times hid the pursuing tyrant beneath the waves of the sea"; according to the rubric, heirmoi – twice, and troparia – on 12 (today – with heirmos on 4), with the refrain "Glory to Thee, O Lord, for Thy holy burial", after which Katavasia and heirmos – both choirs together.
After the 3rd Ode – Sessional Hymn, and after the 6th – Kondakion-Ikos of Great Saturday; after the 9th "It is truly meet" will not be, but only the heirmos of this ode.
3.	Trisagion and the rest with "Our Father" and Troparion "When Thou didst descend".
4.	Litany "Have mercy on us, O God", which is at the Midnight Office, and dismissal of Matins of Great Saturday , beginning from "Glory to Thee, O Christ God".
5.	At the end: "The noble Joseph" (3) with prostrations, as at Matins of Great Saturday, but the Shroud is kissed only by the sacred ministers, according to rank, and the bishop, taking the Shroud from the Tomb, hands it to four canons and thus all the sacred ministers return to the sanctuary and four canons hang the Shroud behind the holy table over the High Place . Then they depart to the sacristy, take off the violet vestments and vest in all bright sacred vestments of their rank, and at this time in the church all candles are lit.
Note on the Shroud
Regarding the time and place of the placing of the Shroud we do not find an ancient rubric, for this rite is later and different in different regions. According to the custom of our archcathedral church the Shroud remains hung behind the holy table, over the High Place, from Resurrection Matins to the Leavetaking of the Resurrection inclusive, that is until Wednesday before the Ascension. According to the custom of our other churches, the Shroud, taken from the Tomb before Resurrection Matins, is placed on the holy table, where it remains during the whole Bright Week, and from the Sunday of Ap. Thomas to the Leavetaking of the Resurrection – behind the holy table. According to others – it remains on the altar, the antimension with the Gospel is placed on it and the Liturgy is celebrated on it. However, it is better to place the Shroud behind the holy table, for lying on the altar, it is often significantly damaged by candles, from which wax drips on it.
Beginning of Holy Pentecost
PROCESSION WITH THE HOLY MYSTERIES AROUND THE CHURCH 
After the Shroud is taken from the Tomb of God and transferred to the sanctuary, the sacred ministers, having dressed in all the brightest sacred vestments of their rank, go out before the steps of the altar and, having bowed all together low to the Holy Mysteries, bend their knees and receive lit candles; so also the brotherhood in the church. The deacon, who is on the right (or the priest himself, if there be no deacons) approaches the middle of the altar and, having bowed low, places the Gospel on its right side, then, having taken the Holy Mysteries from the tabernacle and placed them on the antimension, steps aside a little, and the bishop (or main priest), having censed the Holy Mysteries three times, as usual, and having taken upon himself the omophorion, rises, ascends the steps and, having bowed, receives the Holy Mysteries, after which turns to the people and begins to sing the sticheron "Thy Resurrection, O Christ Savior". Under the joyful sound of all bells the procession around the church takes place, with everything, as was given on Great Friday at Vespers, here on page 394, except the Shroud, which now, by the decision of bl. m. Cardinal Sembratovych, should not be carried, for this does not correspond to the joy of the Resurrection; rather it is fitting to carry the icon of the Resurrection, as it is in the Triodion, at the beginning of Resurrection Matins, during the procession to the church doors. Therefore, when the main sacred minister begins to sing the sticheron "Thy Resurrection, O Christ Savior", the choirs and people take up the singing and sing it, repeating, all the time, until the procession ends, namely the circuit of the church either three times, or at least once. When the circuit ends, all enter the church; in order, however, to avoid confusion during the second procession, those carrying banners and icons remain before the church doors, and in the church prepare for the procession the cross-bearer with two candle-bearers, the brotherhood, choirs and clergy. When the sacred ministers enter the sanctuary, the main priest ascends to the altar and, having turned to the people, blesses them with the Holy Mysteries, quietly saying: "Save, O God, Thy people and bless Thine inheritance", places the Holy Mysteries on the altar, descends before the steps, bends the knees and, having taken off the omophorion, censes the Holy Mysteries three times, as usual; the deacon, having approached the Holy Mysteries, bows low, takes them with the stand from the monstrance and places into the artophorion, and places the artophorion into the tabernacle and, having bowed, locks it. And where there will be no monstrance, the Holy Mysteries are placed in the artophorion and with it are locked in the tabernacle.
Note: This procession with the Holy Mysteries before Resurrection Matins – is a later addition of our churches, borrowed not from the Greeks and not from the Romans, but only from the Latin churches of these parts, superfluous to the majesty of our Resurrection Matins and is not given in our rubrics.
 
RESURRECTION MATINS
1.	PROCESSION BEFORE THE CHURCH DOORS. All people go out of the church, and after them go out also the sacred ministers. And the procession takes place thus: All sacred ministers, in all their sacred bright vestments, stand before the steps of the altar. The main sacred minister takes the cross, the deacon – the censer, all together bow low to the Holy Mysteries and turn to the west. The main one begins to sing the sticheron "Thy Resurrection, O Christ Savior", all take up the singing of the sticheron and go out from the sanctuary to the church: the priest – through the holy [doors], and all other sacred ministers – through the deacon's doors; at this time all bells ring, and all go to the great church doors and, having gone out of the church, stand according to rank before the church doors, which are immediately closed . In the middle of the church is placed on the holy table first of all the icon of the Resurrection of Christ, usually on the Artos, also other holy icons, reliquaries and the book of the Holy Gospels in the most precious binding or something else of the sacred things, all this – according to the number of priests who will give them to be kissed by the people at the end of Matins. Outside, before the church doors, Matins begins in the following way .
2.	BEGINNING OF MATINS. Immediately after the church doors are closed, the main priest, holding with his left hand the cross, and with his right – the censer and censing the church doors , exclaims loudly: "Glory to the Holy" and the rest. The choir responds: "Amen"; the priest gives up the censer and sings loudly the troparion "Christ is risen", also all – the same, then the priest the second time – the same and all – the same, and the third time the priest – the same and all – the same, then the priest in a high voice exclaims the verses, and all after each verse sing this troparion once . At the end the priest, having sung in a higher voice the same troparion only up to "trampling down death by death" inclusive, opens the doors, and all finish: "and upon those in the tombs bestowing life" and again all bells ring, all enter the church . The Matins prayers at Resurrection Matins throughout the whole Bright Week are not recited, for they are connected with the Six Psalms, and since there will be no Six Psalms here, there will be no prayers. If it were necessary to recite the prayers, it should be indicated in the rubric where they should be recited, for during the verses "Let God arise", which take the place of the Six Psalms, it is not possible to recite them, for at this time the rubric orders the priest to sing verses, and not to add prayers as well.
3.	ENTRANCE INTO THE CHURCH. The entrance of the procession into the church takes place in the reverse order to the exit from the church, that is first enters the main priest, after him – other priests and sacred ministers, all the clergy, then singers, brotherhood, banner- and icon-bearers, the cross-bearer and all people. The priests enter the sanctuary and approach the holy table. The bishop, if there be one, departs to his throne. The deacon stands in his place before the holy doors and sings from there the litany.
4.	After the entrance into the church the first deacon sings the great litany "In peace let us pray to the Lord", standing in the usual place, and immediately we sing the Canon.
5.	Canon of the Resurrection: heirmoi – 4 times (in Greek ones – twice), troparia – on 12. (Today heirmoi – once, troparia with heirmos – on 4). Katavasia after each ode – heirmos of the canon, both choirs together – once. The priest sings the heirmoi, and the choirs – the troparia and Katavasia. Refrain to the troparia of the canon – "Christ is risen from the dead", at the penultimate – "Glory", and at the last – "Both now", as usual.
At the beginning of the canon, after the singing of the heirmos, the priest censes everything, as usual .
After each ode the deacons, from their usual places before the holy doors, sing the small litany with separate exclamations, which the priests sing alternately in the sanctuary .
After the 3rd Ode – Hypakoe; after the 6th – Kondakion-Ikos and "The Resurrection of Christ" (3), "Jesus having risen from the grave" once (according to others – three times); at the 9th, after "O Theotokos and Mother of Light", the usual censing takes place and, instead of "More honorable" we sing "The angel cried" and "Shine, shine"; after the 9th – Exaposteilarion of the Resurrection three times.
6.	Stichera of the Praises – 8: 4 Sunday of the Octoechos of Tone 1, with the usual verses from "Praise Him", and 4 of the Resurrection with specific verses, then Glory, Both now: to the Resurrection, "Christ is risen" (3), can be more, until the kissing is finished.
7.	KISSING ONE ANOTHER. Is prescribed in the rubrics at "Christ is risen", after the conclusion of the last sticheron of the Resurrection. However, today we do not kiss one another as in the sticheron: "and let us embrace one another", but we kiss only the precious cross, the Gospel and holy icons, which the priests hold, greeting everyone who approaches with the words: "Christ is risen", and they answer: "Truly He is risen". If there be many people, then we begin the kissing not after the stichera of the Resurrection, but from their beginning, that is from the verse "Let God arise". If there be very many people, then the kissing will be also during the canon. And this kissing takes place thus:
If there be only one priest, he stands in the holy doors and from there gives the cross to be kissed by the people, greeting everyone: "Christ is risen", and the one who kisses answers: "Truly He is risen". If there be several priests, then first the main one goes out from the holy doors and stands before the iconostasis, on the right side, that is opposite the icon of the Savior, looking to the north. After him the second priest comes out from the holy doors with the Gospel, approaches the main one, and he gives him the cross to kiss, saying: "Christ is risen", having kissed, in his turn, gives him the Gospel to kiss, answering: "Truly He is risen" and stands on his left. Then comes out the third priest with the icon of the Resurrection of Christ, approaches the first and he gives him the cross to kiss, saying: "Christ is risen", and having kissed gives him the icon of the Resurrection to kiss, answering: "Truly He is risen", and approaches the second priest, who gives him the Gospel to kiss, saying: "Christ is risen", and he, having kissed the Gospel, gives the second to kiss the icon of the Resurrection, answering: "Truly He is risen", and stands on the left of the second. The fourth priest comes out with the icon of the Theotokos, approaches the first, also the second and the third, of whom each gives him his object to kiss, saying: "Christ is risen", and having kissed gives each of them the icon of the Theotokos to kiss, answering: "Truly He is risen". So do also all other priests, as many as there be. In cathedral churches the bishop, sitting on his throne opposite the icon of the Savior, gives the cross to be kissed, also each of the canons gives his insignia to be kissed, sitting on the seat. And when the kissing between the priests ends, then other sacred ministers and all the people approach one by one each priest in turn, starting from the first, and kiss his insignia, answering: "Truly He is risen" . After the kissing once was read the "Homily" of Chrysostom, which is in the Flower Triodion.
8.	Litanies "Have mercy on us, O God" and "Let us complete" are sung by deacons, standing in their usual places.
9.	Great Dismissal, specific, at which, instead of "More honorable", we sing "Shine, shine" and, instead of "Glory, Both now", we sing "Christ is risen" once. The priest stands with the cross in the holy doors, and the deacon (if there be none, then the priest himself) exclaims: "Wisdom". Choir (or second deacon, if there be one) : "Bless".
Priest: "Blessed be Christ our God ... ages".
Choir: "Amen". "Confirm, O God, the catholic faith unto ages of ages".
Priest: "Most Holy Theotokos, save us".
Choir: "Shine, shine...".
Priest: "Glory to Thee, O Christ God, our hope, glory to Thee".
Choir: "Christ is risen from the dead ... bestowing". "Lord, have mercy" (3), "Lord, bless".
Priest: Dismissal with the cross: "Christ, who rose from the dead, trampling down death by death and upon those in the tombs bestowing life, our true God, through the prayers of His most pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and all-laudable apostles, of our venerable and God-bearing fathers and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and loves mankind".
Then, raising the cross up, exclaims: "Christ is risen" (3), and we each time answer: "Truly He is risen". We sing the final "Christ is risen" (3), the whole troparion, and after this we finish with the singing "and to us He has granted life eternal, let us worship His Resurrection on the third day" .
Note on the doors of the iconostasis
"Let it be known also that throughout the whole Bright Week the great holy doors of the iconostasis and the small side ones in all churches remain open also during communion" (Rubric of our Pochayiv Triodion and Russian Typika).
RESURRECTION HOURS
Instead of each of the four Hours, also instead of Compline and the Midnight Office, throughout the whole Bright Week we celebrate a short order, given in the Triodion, in our Horologia and Molitvoslovs at Resurrection Matins.
Note: If the Hours are read together, then "Blessed is our God" we say only at the 1st Hour, and the others we begin from "Christ is risen" (3).
AT THE LITURGY
Everything – according to the general rubric of a feast of the Lord, only:
1.	Instead of "O Heavenly King", at the Proskomedia, at the Liturgy and wherever else, we recite "Christ is risen" (3) until the Ascension; and from the Ascension to the Descent [of the Holy Spirit], instead of "O Heavenly King", we read nothing .
2.	Regarding "Christ is risen", one should know that at "Glory to Thee, O Christ God" before the dismissal of the Proskomedia and at the Liturgy we recite "Christ is risen" once, "Lord, have mercy" (3) and "Lord, bless".
At "Blessed is the Kingdom" we sing "Christ is risen" three times, that is once – the priest and both choirs – once each (although in our Triodion is given: "priest – three times and choirs the same – three times"), and where there is only one choir, then the priest – once and the choir – once, then half – the priest and half (from "and upon those in the tombs") – the choir.
Also at "With the fear of God", instead of "Blessed is He that cometh" and instead of "We have seen the true light", we sing "Christ is risen" once. Instead of "Let our mouths be filled" and "Blessed be the name of the Lord" – "Christ is risen" (3) . Among us usually "Christ is risen" is recited also instead of "Be exalted, O God, above the heavens", however, this violates the memory of the mystery of Christ's Ascension, which is mentioned in this place of the Liturgy from the beginning. Our priests say "Christ is risen" (only these two words) also after "With the fear of God", after "Save, O God" and after "Always, now and ever", however, in no rubric do we find this.
3.	Instead of the Trisagion we sing "All who have been baptized into Christ".
4.	During the reading of the Gospel, at each verse, all bells are rung .
Our Service Books: "If served conciliarly, then this Gospel is read by all priests and deacons by verses as the superior decides". About this you have a detailed rubric in our and Russian Triodia. However, the custom that one and the same Gospel be read by all priests and deacons – is a superfluous invention of the Greco-Slavs, which today takes place among us only when the Gospel is read in different languages, as happens in our cathedral temples, in which the bishop reads it in Greek from the holy doors, then the deacon – in Slavonic from the ambo, and at the end canons and priests, placed throughout the whole church, in different liturgical languages. In Russia the bishop reads the Gospel in Slavonic, and other priests – in Hebrew, in Greek and in Latin, in those languages in which the inscription on the Cross was written, then in other new languages (Muralt. 14. Brief. S. 142). The Greeks also read the Gospel, according to the new custom, in different languages, however, not at the Liturgy, but at Vespers (the Gospel read at Vespers of this day), as happens in the Patriarchate of Constantinople .
5.	Instead of "It is truly meet", according to the new rubric, we sing the heirmos "Shine, shine" with the refrain "The angel cried" as in the Triodion and in the Constantinopolitan Typikon, but without the troparia of the 9th Ode of the Canon, as in our Service Books, for these troparia are not about the Most Holy Theotokos, but about Christ's Resurrection.
6.	Before the dismissal, instead of "More honorable", we sing "Shine, shine" and instead of "Glory, Both now" – "Christ is risen" once. Dismissal with the cross and the rest, which is after the dismissal with the raising of the cross exactly as was indicated for Resurrection Matins.
7.	BLESSING OF THE ARTOS. After the Prayer behind the Ambo  takes place the blessing of the Artos, for which you have the prayer in the Service Book after the Liturgy of the Resurrection; after the prayer the Artos is sprinkled with holy water. And this Artos with the feast, that is the icon of the Resurrection, after the dismissal of the Liturgy, is carried from the altar, on which it was blessed, to the tetrapod, where it remains until Bright Saturday and the faithful entering the church kiss it. On Bright Saturday at the Liturgy, after the Prayer behind the Ambo, the priest, having come out through the holy doors, reads over it the prayer for breaking, given only in our Service Book on Bright Saturday, and after this, it is taken from the tetrapod, broken in the sacristy and on the next day, that is on the Sunday of Ap. Thomas, after the Prayer behind the Ambo, is distributed to the faithful by the priest standing in the holy doors .
Note: Throughout the whole Bright Week it is permitted to eat meat dishes.
BLESSING OF PASCHAL FOODS
It takes place, according to our custom and according to the rubric of the Triodion, outside the church or after the Liturgy (and then, going out of the church, we sing the Stichera of the Resurrection at will), or after Matins, or in homes on Saturday evening. The order of this blessing with sprinkling with holy water at the end you have both in the Service Book, and in the Trebnik, and in the Triodion, and in the Molitvoslov, after the Resurrection Hours.
ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION IN THE EVENING
AT VESPERS
Notes
1.	The sacred ministers, dressed in all sacred vestments of their rank during the whole Vespers stand in the sanctuary at the altar, coming out only for the Entrance (and deacons – also for the litanies) before the holy doors and for the final kissing of the sacred insignia, if there be several priests – as was given for Matins .
2.	Censing is done three times, that is at the usual beginning, only before the holy table, then at "Lord, I have cried" and at "O Gladsome Light", as usual.
3.	Entrance takes place with the Gospel, for it is to be read.
RUBRIC
1.	The priest and deacons, if there be any, dressed in all sacred vestments of their rank, come before the steps of the altar and bow low, as usual. The priest receives the censer with the usual prayer of blessing the censer, censes before the holy table, exclaiming: "Blessed is our God" ; then, having given up the censer, ascends with the deacons the steps and sings "Christ is risen" once and both choirs – once each. After this the priest recites clearly "Let God arise" and other verses with "Glory, Both now". The choirs, at each verse, sing "Christ is risen" once or three times exactly as was indicated for the beginning of Matins. Afterwards the priest: "Christ is risen" up to "trampling down death by death", and the choirs: "and upon those in the tombs" and the rest.
2.	"In peace let us pray to the Lord" the priest sings at the altar, and if a deacon – then before the iconostasis.
3.	"Lord, I have cried" – in Tone 2, with the usual censing. Stichera – Resurrection of the Octoechos of Tone 2, given in the Triodion; Glory: Triodion, Both now: 1st Theotokion (Dogmatikon) of Tone 2.
4.	Entrance with the Gospel and usual censing at "O Gladsome Light"; and, after the Great Prokeimenon, the deacon, and if there be none, then the priest himself: "And that we may be accounted worthy", priest: "The Reading from John...". Deacon: "Let us attend", and the priest himself reads the Gospel from the holy doors (From John Sect. 65, up to "not believe").
5.	"Let us all say", "Vouchsafe" and "Let us complete".
6.	At the Aposticha: one Resurrection Sticheron of the Octoechos, given in the Triodion, then Resurrection Stichera with their verses and the kissing of the cross, or also of other sacred insignia exactly as was given for Matins. After the final "Christ is risen" immediately dismissal with the cross and the rest exactly as was given for Matins.
COMPLINE AND MIDNIGHT OFFICE: Everything – according to the pattern of the Resurrection Hours, here on page 416.
GENERAL RUBRIC FOR ALL DAYS OF BRIGHT WEEK
AT VESPERS
Everything – as on the day of Resurrection in the evening, here on p. 421, except the Entrance, which takes place with the censer, and not with the Gospel, and there will be no Gospel.
Note
According to the previous rubric the priest, at Vespers of Bright Week, from Monday onwards, should not use all sacred vestments, but from the beginning – only the epitrachelion, from the Entrance to the end – also the phelonion . Among us the custom is observed to use all sacred vestments on the first three days of Bright Week, that is on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday evening, since our people mark all these three days by abstention from work and presence at divine service. On other days of this week it is sufficient to use only the epitrachelion and phelonion.
COMPLINE AND MIDNIGHT OFFICE: According to the pattern of the Resurrection Hours, here on page 416.
AT MATINS
Everything – according to the rubric of the Resurrection, here on page 408, only:
1.	At the beginning of Matins we do not go out before the church doors, but begin it in the sanctuary, before the altar .
2.	We sing the small litany only after the 3rd, 6th and 9th Odes.
AT THE HOURS
Exactly as on the day of Resurrection, only on Bright Saturday the 9th Hour is read already with three psalms, as usual, and at it – Resurrection Troparion of Tone 8 "From the height", and Kondakion – to the Resurrection "Though Thou didst descend into the grave".
AT THE LITURGY
1.	Everything – as on the day of Resurrection, changing daily the Prokeimenon, Apostle, Alleluia and Gospel.
2.	On Saturday, after the Prayer behind the Ambo, we read the prayer for the breaking of the Artos, given in our Liturgikon, in the order of Bright Saturday .
GENERAL RUBRICS from the Sunday of Ap. Thomas to the Ascension
To the divine service from the Sunday of Ap. Thomas to the Ascension one could apply the general rule in the middle of a feast of the Lord. However, since each Sunday, beginning from the Sunday of Ap. Thomas, has a separate name and a separate service, which extends to the other weekdays of the given week and is as if a separate feast in the Easter time, the place of the Resurrection service is taken by the service of the Sunday, also on weekdays, together with some parts of the Sunday service of the Octoechos, except the eight-day feast of Mid-Pentecost, to which the Sunday service yields on weekdays. General rules of this time are as follows:
1.	At the beginning of every service, instead of "O Heavenly King", we sing "Christ is risen" (3) , and at the end of every divine service, according to our custom, we also sing "Christ is risen" (3), also at the end we add: "and to us He has granted life eternal, let us worship His Resurrection on the third day" ; and before the dismissal, instead of "More honorable", we sing "Shine, shine" .
2.	At Vespers: On Sunday evening for Monday there will be no Entrance, as happens on the Sundays of Lent (for here there is no Great Prokeimenon, and the Triodia give the litany "Have mercy on us, O God" at the end of Vespers), except the Sunday of Ap. Thomas, which, as a feast of the Lord, has also a Great Prokeimenon. Finally, in the provinces the Great Entrance is made every Sunday evening, regardless of whether there is a feast or not.
3.	At Compline: From today we begin to sing the Canons of the Theotokos. After "It is truly meet" throughout the whole week, we recite the Kondakion of the Sunday; only during the eight days of the feast of Mid-Pentecost we read the Kondakion of Mid-Pentecost.
4.	We sing the Midnight Office as usual, only after the 1st Trisagion on the feast of Mid-Pentecost we take the Troparion of Mid-Pentecost, and on the Leavetaking of the Resurrection – the Resurrection Troparion of the Sunday with its Theotokion; and after the 2nd Trisagion in the middle of Mid-Pentecost we take the Kondakion of Mid-Pentecost, and outside Mid-Pentecost – Kondakion of the Resurrection. The prayer "Remember, O Lord" will not be.
5.	We begin Matins from "Glory to the Holy" and immediately "Christ is risen" (3), then "Glory to God in the highest" and the rest; before the 50th Psalm we recite "The Resurrection of Christ": on Sundays – three times, and on weekdays – once .
6.	At the Hours: after "Blessed is our God" we recite "Christ is risen" (3), and after the dismissal – "Christ is risen" (3) and add: "and to us He has granted life eternal" and further.
Note: Since we do not exclaim "Blessed is our God" when the Hour is combined with Matins or with the preceding one, also since we do not impart the dismissal when the Hour is combined with the following one, then we do not read "Christ is risen" then.
7.	At the Liturgy: "Christ is risen" we sing where also on the Resurrection of Christ; here, on pp. 416-418.
Antiphons: the two first – Resurrection, and the third – daily with the Resurrection refrain, also at "O come, let us worship" both on Sundays and on weekdays.
We conclude the troparia with the Kondakion of the Resurrection , except the Week of Thomas and Mid-Pentecost, for then we conclude with their kondakion just as in the Triodion; although the troparia of the Week of Thomas can be concluded also with the Kondakion of the Resurrection, as it is in our Service Books, in our Manuscript Typikon and Tserkovne Oko.
Instead of "It is truly meet" we sing "The angel cried" and "Shine, shine", except the eight days of Mid-Pentecost, which has its heirmos.
We sing the Resurrection dismissal, except the Week of Thomas, which has a specific dismissal. The dismissal with the cross we sing only on Sundays , on the feast of Mid-Pentecost  and on the Leavetaking of the Resurrection .
We suppose that also on some other days, when there be a sufficient number of people, it would be good to sing the dismissal with the cross, however, not every day, as some do, having for this neither rubric nor general custom.
8.	The services of saints without Polyeleos, which fall on these Sundays, as also on others until Pentecost, on the feast of Mid-Pentecost and on the Leavetaking of the Resurrection, we take at Compline.

The prayers with bending of knees are read in three places of Vespers: after the Great Prokeimenon, after "Let us all say" and after "Vouchsafe, O Lord". At each of these three stations of prayers the small litany is sung, each time with a separate exclamation, however, thus: "Lord, have mercy" (3), then the priest – one station of prayers with bending of knees; at the end of the station the deacon or priest continues the small litany, that is: "Help us, save us, have mercy", "Commemorating our most holy, most pure", exclamation. So – at each station.

BEGINNING OF THE FAST OF THE SAINTS
CHIEF APOSTLES PETER AND PAUL
This fast begins on Monday after the Sunday of All Saints, and ends on the Eve of the feast of the Holy Apostles. Regarding the divine service on this, first, Monday, if a saint with Polyeleos does not fall, "Alleluia" was sung once and the whole church rule was Lenten, as on Lenten days of Great Lent; however, now we limit "Alleluia" to Great Lent, and here we sing "God is the Lord".
Regarding the fast; the Synod of Lviv limits it to Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays of each of its weeks and permits also dairy products; on the other four days it permits meat, however, on the condition of the 50th Psalm for the clergy, and 5 "Our Father" and 5 "Virgin Theotokos" for the laity, before lunch and before supper .
On Thursday after the Sunday of All Saints
FEAST OF THE MOST HOLY EUCHARIST
Transferred to the second Sunday after the Descent.
This feast lasts eight days: from Thursday after the Sunday of All Saints to the next [Thursday], on which it is leavetaken. But since, according to our custom, it is transferred from Thursday to the following Sunday, the Synod of Lviv orders to sing the service of this feast on Sunday, with All-Night Vigil, exactly as given in the Triodion on Thursday of the feast itself, according to the general rubric of a feast of the Lord of the first rank, without the Sunday [service]; and on the days preceding and following this Sunday, to sing it according to the general rubric in the middle of a feast of the Lord. Besides this, the Synod orders that the procession with the Holy Mysteries take place on the Sunday itself, after the Prayer behind the Ambo, as usual, that is from the church to four altars, erected outside the church and equally distant from one another. Where this would be impossible, it will be sufficient to begin the procession from the altar in the church and, having gone around the church three times, to end this rite on the same altar in the church with the blessing with the Holy Mysteries. Regarding the four readings of the Gospel, which are usually sung at each of the four altars, the Synod orders to choose those in which there is mention of the Most Holy Mysteries, according to the rubric prescribed for this feast .
After this two rubrics must be given: 1. How on this feast the Exposition of the Holy Mysteries takes place; 2. How the procession with the Holy Mysteries takes place.
RUBRIC I
ON THE EXPOSITION OF THE HOLY MYSTERIES
AT THE LITURGY
The priest, on one of the days preceding the feast, let him consecrate at the Liturgy two Lambs: one let him consume at Communion, and the other let him place in the tabernacle and keep until the day of the feast. All this let him do according to the rubric given for Great Thursday here, on page 385, in the note. On the day of the feast itself, after the Proskomedia, immediately before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy, after the censing of everything as usual by deacons (or by the priest himself), the exposition of the Holy Mysteries takes place in the following way: the first deacon (who is on the right of the priest) places the Gospel on the right side of the holy table, unlocks the artophorion and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, takes from the artophorion the pyx, all bend their knees, and he places it on the folded antimension; if there be a monstrance, then he unlocks the pyx, takes from it the Lamb, not touching it with his fingers, but holding by the stand on which it lies, places it into the groove of the monstrance, locks it well, then places the pyx into the artophorion, bows before it and, having locked the artophorion, places the monstrance, turned with face side to the people, on the antimension and steps aside a little to the right side. The priest puts incense into the censer, blesses it, saying: "Blessed is our God", and censes with both hands the Holy Mysteries three times, bowing his head at each censing. Then, having taken upon himself with the help of the second deacon the omophorion, approaches the holy table and, having bowed low, with the help of the first deacon takes with both hands with the omophorion the monstrance and, having turned it with the reverse side to himself, turns his right side to the people and sings solemnly and majestically the beginning of the first strophe: "O saving Victim", and all people continue to sing the same strophe. And again the priest – the beginning of the second strophe: "To the One God in Trinity", and all sing the rest. The priest signs the people crosswise with the Holy Mysteries, then goes in a semicircle from the southern side to the northern and, having returned by the northern to the altar, places the monstrance on the antimension, having turned it with the help of the deacon with face side to the people. Then, having stepped aside a little to the left, descends before the steps of the altar so as not to turn his back to the Holy Mysteries, kneels and, having put aside the omophorion and having censed again three times the Holy Mysteries, as at the beginning, waits, kneeling, until the deacon, having approached the middle of the altar and bowed low, places the Holy Mysteries on the tabernacle. Then the priest, having ascended the steps, begins the Liturgy from "Blessed is the Kingdom", "O Heavenly King" and the rest. During the Liturgy the sacred ministers never turn their backs to the Holy Mysteries, as our Service Books prescribe: "When (the priest), according to the ritual prescriptions, has to turn to the people, he should not turn from the middle of the altar, so as not to turn his back to the Body of Christ, but, having bowed low and stepped aside a little to the left side, from this side turns to the people and, having turned again to the altar, bows low to the Body of Christ, and then, when the priest has to make a full turn, as at 'Always, now and ever', when he turns with the Holy Mysteries, then he does not make a full turn, so as not to turn his back to the Body of Christ" . Let us add also that when the priest or deacon goes out before the iconostasis for censing, he does not cense from the middle, nor turns his back to the Holy Mysteries, but stands a little on the side, the priest – from the side of the Theotokos, and the deacons: one – from the side of the Savior, and the other – of the Theotokos.
Notes
1.	If there be no monstrance, then the Holy Mysteries are exposed in the pyx.
2.	After the cleansing of the chalice the priest does not place the Gospel on the antimension, since after the Prayer behind the Ambo the Holy Mysteries will have to be placed on the altar.
3.	If there be no deacons, then the priest does all this himself.
RUBRIC II
ON THE PROCESSION WITH THE HOLY MYSTERIES AFTER THE PRAYER BEHIND THE AMBO
After the conclusion of the Prayer behind the Ambo the sacred ministers stand before the steps of the altar, and the first deacon ascends the steps and, having bowed low, takes down the Holy Mysteries from the tabernacle, places on the folded antimension and steps aside a little to his side. All kneel, and the priest, having censed three times the Holy Mysteries and having taken upon himself the omophorion, ascends the steps, with the help of the deacon takes with both hands the Holy Mysteries, turns to the people, as at the beginning of the Liturgy, and, having begun the troparion "Bread transubstantiated" or some other pious hymn, preceded by two deacons with censers, enters under the canopy and proceeds to the church doors to the sounds of bells and the procession from the church to the first altar begins, and the choir and people continue to sing the troparion or something else. The order of the procession is such. In front goes the cross-bearer between two candle-bearers, then banner- and icon-bearers, then four girls with icons, after them the church brotherhood, two by two, with candles, choirs and all the clergy, two by two, with candles, according to their dignity: the nearest priests – in phelonia, and others – in epitrachelia, the last – the main priest with the Holy Mysteries, preceded by two deacons, who from the sides unceasingly cense, and candle-bearers surrounding the canopy. When the procession arrives at the first altar and stops near it, all the clergy divides into two wings, the canopy is placed opposite the altar, and the priest with the Holy Mysteries ascends to the altar and, with the help of the deacon, places the Holy Mysteries on the folded antimension; then, having bent his knees, censes them three times and, having risen, steps aside a little to the left and turns to the people. Then the Gospel-bearers approach the priest, the priest opens the Gospel at the place of the 1st reading, and the first deacon exclaims: "And that we may be accounted worthy" etc., choir responds "Lord, have mercy" (3), priest sings: "Peace be to all"; second deacon: "Wisdom, Aright. Let us listen" etc., priest: "The Reading from the Holy Gospel according to (Name)" and, when the first deacon exclaims: "Let us attend", the priest reads the first Gospel (Matthew, Section 108. 17-30). After the conclusion of the reading he kisses its beginning and, having bent his knees before the Holy Mysteries, sings (if there is a custom) with other sacred ministers the first member of the supplicatory song "Holy God" three times and all people – the same three times. Then, having again censed the Holy Mysteries three times and risen, bows low, takes the Holy Mysteries with both hands and, having turned to the right to the people blesses them crosswise once (bishop – three times), saying quietly: "Save, O God, Thy people and bless Thine inheritance", and so, to the singing of the festal troparion or other hymn, the priest enters under the canopy and the procession moves to the second altar, from it – to the third, then – to the fourth, and at each everything takes place exactly as at the first, only the members of the supplicatory song and the readings of the Gospels are changed, of which the second will be from Mark, Section 64.12-26; the third – from Luke, Section 108.7-22; the fourth – from John, Section 23.48-58. If there be several priests, they read the Gospels alternately. After this the procession returns to the church and the priest, having placed the Holy Mysteries on the altar, kneels, censes them three times, rises and, having taken the Holy Mysteries and turned to the people, sings solemnly and majestically the verse of the Ambrosian hymn: "Save Thy people, O Lord" (3), and the people repeat the first and second time the same, and when the priest sings it the third time and finishes with the words "and bless Thine inheritance" blessing the people once, then the people sing the further verses of this hymn, and the priest, having turned with the northern side to the altar and placed the Holy Mysteries on it, descends before the steps, puts aside the omophorion, kneels and censes them three times. Then the right deacon approaches the Holy Mysteries, bows low, takes from the tabernacle the pyx and, having taken the Lamb from the monstrance, places it with the stand into the pyx, and places it into the tabernacle and, having again bowed, locks the tabernacle and places the Gospel on the antimension. If there be no deacon, then the priest himself does all this. Then all rise, and the choir sings "Blessed be the name of the Lord" and the rest of the Liturgy, as usual.
Notes
1.	In case it is impossible to have four altars, see what the Synod of Lviv prescribes here, on page 448.
2.	The Lamb placed in the tabernacle, let the priest consume on the next day at the Liturgy together with the other, consecrated at this Liturgy: first – the consecrated, and then – the presanctified.
3.	On Sunday evening at Vespers we sing the Great Prokeimenon of the feast, given in the Triodion on the previous Thursday evening.
