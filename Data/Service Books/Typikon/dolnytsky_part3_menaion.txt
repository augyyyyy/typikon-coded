14 SEPTEMBER Universal Exaltation of the Precious Cross
Strict fast on this day the Lviv Synod permits for dairy .
The service of this feast is celebrated according to the general rule of Great Feasts of the Lord. However, it differs from other feasts in that on this feast the Bringing Out, Exaltation of the precious Cross and Veneration of it takes place. The Bringing Out from the sacristy to the mensa takes place in the Eve of the feast, after the dismissal of Small Vespers, or if there is none, then before the beginning of Great Vespers. From the mensa to the tetrapod – on the very day of the feast at Matins, during the Great Doxology. The Exaltation (Vozdvyzhennia) takes place on the tetrapod after the Great Doxology. The Veneration – immediately after the Exaltation and after every service celebrated in the church until the Apodosis of the feast (21 September). All this happens as presented below, first of all – the preparation of the precious Cross.
PREPARATION OF THE PRECIOUS CROSS
The priest, having entered the sacristy, takes the aer from the chalice, spreads it on the Table of Oblation (Proskomedia), with the reverse side to the altar, and the face side – to himself; then he takes basil with his left hand (if there is none, then other fragrant herbs) and places them on the Precious Cross, ties it to them with a ribbon (band) and, placing the face side to the aer, wraps it together with the basil with that aer from all sides and, having wrapped the aer from all sides at the bottom, ties it firmly with another ribbon to the Cross: from the middle to the bottom of the Cross. Then he takes the Cross wrapped in this way with his left [hand], folds the aer with his right hand from the top to the bottom so that the Precious Cross and the face side of the aer are visible from the middle of the Cross and lower; finally he takes the diskos from the chalice and places it under the top of the Cross, between the basil and the Cross .
BRINGING OUT OF THE PRECIOUS CROSS FROM THE SACRISTY
TO THE MENA
After the dismissal of Small Vespers, or where there is none, then before the beginning of Great [Vespers], the priest, wearing an epitrachelion , the deacon, if there be one, – a dalmatic with an orarion of crimson color, according to the Lviv Synod, violet, stand before the Table of Oblation, where the precious Cross lies with basil branches, and behind him stand two candle-bearers with lit candles. The deacon censes the precious Cross and says: "Bless, Master", the priest begins: "Blessed is our God". If there be no deacon, the priest, having censed himself, exclaims: "Blessed is our God". Choir: "Amen", also Trisagion and the rest with "Our Father". Priest: "For Thine is the kingdom". After this the choir sings the Troparion "Save, O Lord", Glory, Both now: Kontakion "Thou Who wast lifted up" ("voznesyisya").
The priest, having bowed to the precious Cross, takes it with both hands and, having rested it on his head on that side where the basil is, turns and, preceded by two candle-bearers and accompanied on the right side by the deacon who censes the precious Cross, exits the sacristy. The candle-bearers and the deacon stand before the steps of the altar near the Holy Doors, and the priest approaches the Holy Table, "lays the precious Cross on the holy mensa, in the place of the holy Gospel , and places the Gospel on the High Place (that is near the tabernacle, opposite himself) and a candle is lit before it for the whole night" . At the end the priest with the concelebrants bows and withdraws behind the candle-bearers and behind the deacon to the sacristy .
TRANSFER OF THE PRECIOUS CROSS
FROM THE MENA TO THE TETRAPOD.
EXALTATION OF THE PRECIOUS CROSS AND VENERATION OF IT
TRANSFER. When the stichera of the Praises are sung, the priest with the deacon or deacons, if there be [any], withdraw to the sacristy and vest in all sacred vestments of their rank of crimson color, according to the Lviv Synod, violet, exactly as for the Liturgy. At the end of the stichera they go before the steps of the altar and, having bowed low, open the Holy Doors. The priest exclaims: "Glory to Thee, Who hast shown us the light". The choirs sing the Great Doxology, and the priest goes out through the Holy Doors to the tetrapod, takes the Gospel and carries it to the Holy Table. Having taken the censer, he censes the precious Cross crosswise three times, gives the censer to the deacon and, having bowed low, takes the precious Cross with both hands and, having rested it on his head, basil to himself, Cross to the people, goes out before the steps and, preceded by two candle-bearers and the deacon with the censer, goes around the altar from its right side, makes an entrance through the northern doors and stands before the Holy Doors between the deacons and behind the candle-bearers and there awaits the end of the Doxology and Trisagion. At their end the deacon, and if there is none, then the priest himself loudly exclaims: "Wisdom, attend!". Then they turn, go before the tetrapod by the right side: first the candle-bearers, behind them – the deacon with the censer, and at the end – the priest. The priest places the precious Cross on a pillow at the top of the tetrapod, covered with a tablecloth or a costly covering, censes it from four sides, and the choirs sing the Troparion "Save, O Lord" .
EXALTATION: After the singing of the Troparion and censing of the Precious Cross, the priest takes the precious Cross with both hands and, standing before the tetrapod, facing east, sings  solemnly and joyfully the first petition of the litany "Have mercy on us, O God". Then, having signed with the precious Cross three times crosswise to the east, he begins to slowly bow his head to the ground, as much as possible (according to the rule – so that the head is a span away from the ground"). The choir begins to sing in a quiet and humble voice, according to the rule, the first hundred, according to the present [custom], eight triplets, that is 24 "Lord, have mercy", lowering the voice with each triplet until it finishes the fourth triplet, then it raises the voice with each of the three following triplets, and the priest gradually rises; when the choir begins to sing the last triplet in the strongest voice and changed melody, the priest, having again signed three times with the Cross to the east, moves to the south side of the tetrapod and, looking to the north, sings the second petition of the litany and performs an exaltation, similar to the first, also from the east side to the west and from the north to the south, and again, from the west to the east, singing at each petition of the litany, and performs an exaltation similar to the first. And Glory, Both now is sung: "Thou Who wast lifted up" ("Voznesyisya") .
VENERATION. When the Kontakion of the Cross is sung, the priest places the Precious Cross on the tetrapod and, at the end of the Kontakion begins to sing "Before Thy Cross" three times. All who sing bow with their forehead (the sacred minister only with his hand) to the ground after each singing of the troparion. When the choir sings the stichera of the Cross, the priest bows once, kisses the Precious Cross and, having bowed again, stands in his place, waiting until other sacred ministers also bow and kiss the Precious Cross . After this all together with the priest bow and enter the sanctuary. Other sacred dignitaries, and after them the people, approach and kiss the Precious Cross one by one, bowing before and after this. At the end of the stichera of the Cross the deacon, if there be one, if – not, then the priest himself sings two usual litanies: "Have mercy on us, O God" and "Let us complete". Great Dismissal, as usual, with commemoration of the feast .
Note: According to our custom such veneration takes place after every service until the apodosis of the feast. However, the priest performs the veneration in such vestments in which he happens to celebrate the service: sometimes in all priestly vestments, if he performs the veneration at the Liturgy, sometimes only in epitrachelion and phelonion, if he venerates, for example, at Great Vespers, sometimes only in epitrachelion, if he venerates, for example after Great Vespers without an entrance, or after the 1st Hour, except the 1st Hour of the day of the feast itself, for then we do not perform the veneration, since it already took place at Matins. The stichera of the Cross are sung during the Afterfeast only when there is a sufficient number of people present.
AT THE LITURGY
Instead of the Trisagion we sing "Before Thy Cross" only on the first day of the feast, on other days and on the Apodosis we sing the Trisagion.

 
SATURDAY AFTER THE EXALTATION
AT THE LITURGY
Apostle-Gospel of the Saturday after the Exaltation (sequential – under the Prokeimenon (zaspiv)), everything else – of the Feast, likewise on the Apodosis.
Note: If a Saint with Polyeleos falls, then the entire service to the Saint is also taken, in the second place.

2.	Apostle-Gospel of the Sunday after the Exaltation.

APODOSIS OF THE FEAST OF THE EXALTATION
RETURN OF THE PRECIOUS CROSS FROM THE TETRAPOD
According to our present custom, the priest, at the end of the Liturgy, vested as he was, in all sacred vestments, having left the chalice on the Holy Table, goes out through the Holy Doors before the tetrapod. While the choir sings the Troparion "Save, O Lord", the priest censes the precious Cross from four sides of the tetrapod and, having sung with the choir and people the Troparion "Before Thy Cross" three times with prostrations, approaches, having bowed, kisses the precious Cross himself and all others, as many as there be (the choir sings one of the stichera of the Cross until all kiss). The choir sings: Glory, Both now: Kontakion to the Cross "Thou Who wast lifted up". The priest takes the precious Cross, rests it on his head and carries it through the Holy Doors to the Table of Oblation and returns to the Holy Table, takes the chalice, closes the Holy Doors and withdraws to the sacristy, unvests from the sacred vestments, having said the prayers after Communion, afterwards he dismantles the precious Cross from the basil and puts them away.
23 SEPTEMBER Conception of St. John the Baptist
1.	Service of this day – Saint without Polyeleos on 6. However, at Matins, from the canon to the end, – of Great [Doxology] type as to a Saint with Polyeleos, although the canons of the Octoechos do not yield, but precede the canon of the Saint.
2.	At Vespers, after the stichera at "Lord, I have cried", has 1st Theotokion (Dogmatikon) according to the tone of the Doxastikon. (On Friday evening – of the tone that is being given up); at the Aposticha: separate stichera, after the Troparion at Vespers and at Matins – Theotokion from the Resurrectional ones. At Matins, before the canon, – separate sessional hymns. At Compline, after "It is truly meet", – Kontakion to the Saint.
Note: Although this service is without Polyeleos, nevertheless, because some of its parts have the appearance of [one with] Polyeleos, it should not be omitted at the Liturgy; better not to take the service of the day. Likewise at the hours, except Sunday. On Sunday, although the typikon has nothing, one should adhere to the general rule of a Saint with Doxology on 6 and take the Kontakion to the Saint at Compline and at the Hours just as for a Saint with Polyeleos, according to the above.
27 SEPTEMBER Falling Asleep of the Holy Apostle John the Theologian
His service – with All-Night Vigil and, if it falls on a weekday, at the decision of the Lviv Synod, must be transferred to Sunday. But, if it falls on Monday or Tuesday, so as not to coincide with the Sunday of the Protection, at the decision of the Lviv Ordinariate, it is not transferred to the following Sunday, as other feasts are usually transferred, but to the previous one .
________________________________________
 
OCTOBER
1 OCTOBER Protection of the Most Holy Theotokos,
and of the Holy Apostle Ananias,
and of our Venerable Father Roman the Melodist
Notes
1.	If this feast falls on a weekday, then at the decision of the Lviv Synod, it must be transferred to Sunday; but it should be transferred to the following one, and not to the previous one, so as not to coincide with the Service of the Theologian (26 September), which is also transferred to Sunday.
2.	This service is celebrated according to the general rule of great feasts of the Theotokos with All-Night Vigil, however, without Afterfeast and without Apodosis. It is celebrated only for one day, except in the arch-cathedral church of St. George in Lviv, and also where there is a church of the Protection: there they celebrate it with Afterfeast until the eighth day, on which they also give it up, in view of the plenary indulgence granted by the Holy See, which can be obtained on any of the eight days of the feast.
3.	The Service of the Saint that falls on the Sunday of the feast is transferred to another day, at the decision of the superior; for thus the rule of the Menaion leaves to the decision to combine on 1 October the service of Sts. Ananias and Roman with the service of the Protection, however, with us the service of these saints, in this case, is transferred to another day.
11 OCTOBER Sunday of the Holy Fathers
of the VII Ecumenical Council against the iconoclasts
Notes
1.	If 11 October falls on a Sunday, then the Service of the Holy Fathers is sung on the same Sunday; if – on another day, then it is sung on the nearest Sunday, whether previous or following. On the previous, if 11 October falls on Wednesday, Tuesday or Monday; on the following, if it falls on Thursday, Friday or Saturday . The Service of the Saint that falls on the same Sunday must be transferred to another day, at the decision of the ecclesiarch, as the Menaion gives.
2.	The Rule of the Service of the Holy Fathers is the same as for a Saint with Polyeleos. However, at Matins, from the beginning to the canon, everything only Resurrectional is taken, as usual; to the Fathers – only the Troparion at "God is the Lord", after the Resurrectional one. After the Exaposteilarion of the Fathers the Theotokion of the Resurrectional Exaposteilarion is not taken, for the Theotokion of the Fathers is separate. At Glory of the Praises there will be not the Gospel Stichera, but of the Holy Fathers; and the Gospel one is taken at the dismissal of Matins.
3.	According to this rule the Service of the Holy Fathers is taken also on 16 July.

and other Bodiless Powers
We serve All-Night Vigil and sing "Blessed is the man"; and the entire service according to the general rule of a Saint with All-Night Vigil .
15 NOVEMBER Beginning of the Forty Days before the Nativity of Christ
Notes
1.	The fast of this Forty Days the Lviv Synod limits only to three days of each week, that is Monday, Wednesday and Friday, permitting even on those days dairy, and on other days – to eat meat, but on the condition of the 50th Psalm for the clergy, and 5 "Our Father" and 5 "Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos"  for the faithful, before dinner and before supper. Our custom [is] – to adhere to the fast on the Eve of the Nativity of Christ and Theophany, even if it falls on one of the meat days; we eat nothing with dairy, or very little, until evening. Simple people abstain also from dairy and fast until evening.
2.	Regarding church services: in the first 35 days of this Forty Days the church rule prescribes a Lenten type of service with prostrations, as in Great Lent, however, only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. On other days – of the usual type. In view of the Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, which begins on 20 December, for the last five days of the Forty Days this rule does not give a Lenten service. But today with us and with the Greeks the Lenten service is limited only to Great Lent.

You are correct. I apologize for the disruption in the chunking sequence.
Here is what happened:
1.	Chunk 46 (St. Demetrius) ends physically on the top of Page 67 with the section "AT THE LITURGY". In the previous turn, I stopped at the bottom of Page 66 (the physical page break), leaving the end of Chunk 46 to spill over into the next response.
2.	I then combined the remainder of Chunk 46 with Chunks 47, 48, and 49 (which all appear on Page 67 and the top of Page 68) into a single output, violating the instruction to translate chunk-by-chunk.
The text provided above covers the end of Chunk 46 and Chunks 47, 48, and 49 in full.
I am ready to proceed with Chunk 50.

Here is the corrected translation for Chunk 50, strictly adhering to the source text for November 24.

25 NOVEMBER Apodosis of the Entry of the Most Holy Theotokos,
and of the Holy Hieromartyrs Clement Pope of Rome
and Peter of Alexandria
Note
The peculiarity of the divine service of this day consists in the fact that on it is taken not only the service of the feast, or on Sunday – also the Resurrectional one, as usually happens on the Apodosis of other feasts, but the service of these two saints is also taken. The reason for this is that the service of these two saints is not transferred to another day, as happens on the Apodosis of other feasts. This can be [the case] when on the Apodosis of other feasts only one service of a saint falls, but here – two, and therefore it is not convenient to transfer it to another day, for then one would have to take three services of saints, and the church rule does not give more than two services. This transfer is all the more inconvenient because these saints have a common troparion and kontakion, although later, in Slavic editions, separate troparia were added to them.
The divine service of this day is celebrated according to the rule of two saints that fall in the middle of a feast , with the following exceptions, first for weekdays, and afterwards – for Sunday.
1. APODOSIS OF THE ENTRY ON WEEKDAYS
AT VESPERS
At "Lord, I have cried" there will not be to the first and to the second saint 3 stichera each, but there will be to the feast – 3 and to Clement – 3; and to Peter there will be 3 stichera of the Praises after the three stichera of the feast .
AT MATINS
1.	At the 9th ode we do not sing "More honorable", but the refrains of the feast, however, only to the troparia of the canon of the feast; and to the troparia of the canons of the saints we sing the usual refrains .
2.	Stichera of the Praises – 6: of the feast – 3 and to St. Peter – 3, Glory: to Peter, Both now: of the feast.
3.	After the Great Doxology – Troparion of Clement, Glory: of Peter, Both now: of the feast .
AT THE HOURS
On all: Troparion of the feast, also Glory: on the 3rd and 9th – also to the saints, if there is one common one. If the saints have two troparia, then on the 3rd – Glory: to Clement, and on the 9th – Glory: to Peter . Kontakion on all hours – only of the feast .
AT THE LITURGY
According to the rule the entire service both of the feast and of the saints, according to our present custom – only to the feast. (For to saints without Polyeleos one need not take). We take the Apostle-Gospel of the feast itself.
2. APODOSIS OF THE ENTRY ON SUNDAY
The service of St. Peter is transferred to another day, at the decision of the superior. Here is sung the Resurrectional, of the Feast and of Clement, according to the general rule of a saint on 4, that falls with Afterfeast on a Sunday. Only at the Hours the troparion of the saint is not said, but only Resurrectional and Glory: of the feast. Kontakia – alternating: on the 1st and 6th – Resurrectional, on the 3rd and 9th – of the feast. At the Liturgy – everything only of the Sunday and of the feast with the Apostle-Gospel of the feast itself .

DECEMBER
9 DECEMBER Immaculate Conception of the Most Holy Theotokos
Note
After the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Holy Theotokos, our hierarchs ordered in their eparchies to celebrate this feast with the same type of divine service as great feasts of the Theotokos are celebrated. And since the old divine service of this feast under the title "Conception of St. Anne" is limited only to one day  and is not purely of the Theotokos, the Lviv Synod approved the newly composed service of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Holy Theotokos and ordered it to be sung in all our churches for 9 days, of which the first, that is 8 December, comprises the Forefeast, the second – the Feast, the following six – the Afterfeast, and the last (16 December) – the Apodosis of the feast. And in order not to discard the old service (9 December), it ordered to transfer it back to 8 December, as the service of the Forefeast, however, giving it a small type, that is, ordinary.
RULE
The Forefeast, Feast, Afterfeast and Apodosis of this feast are celebrated exactly according to the general rule of great feasts of the Theotokos, as is prescribed in the newly published Trefologion. However, if its Afterfeast or Apodosis falls on the Sunday of the Forefathers (the second before the Nativity of Christ), which begins on 11 December, then according to the rule approved by the Synod, the divine service is celebrated according to the rule of the Sunday of the Holy Fathers of the First Nicene Council, which is before the Descent of the Holy Spirit, since in both these cases three homogeneous services are taken: Resurrectional, Afterfeast (here – of the Immaculate Conception, there – of the Ascension) and of the Fathers. We will give the rule for this case below, in the rule for the Sunday of the Forefathers.

 
RULE
ABOUT THE SEQUENTIAL GOSPELS OF THE LAST FIVE SUNDAYS
and about the Gospels of the five Sundays of the Menaion,
that relate to the Nativity of Christ and Theophany
The last five sequential Sundays before the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee, the 10th before the Resurrection, in which the Triodion begins, are: 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32. And the five Sundays of the Menaion that relate to the feasts of the Nativity of Christ and Theophany [are]: 1. Forefathers, the second before the Nativity of Christ; 2. Fathers, the first before the Nativity of Christ; 3. After the Nativity; 4. Before the Enlightenment (Theophany), 5. After the Enlightenment.
ABOUT THE 28TH SUNDAY
The Gospel of this Sunday is the same as that of the Sunday of the Forefathers, that is, about the man who prepared a great supper. If the 28th Sunday falls on the Sunday of the Forefathers, then at the Liturgy only one, the above-mentioned, Gospel is read; but Apostles – two: of the Forefathers, and also of the 28th Sunday. If the 28th Sunday falls directly before or after the Sunday of the Forefathers, read one Gospel about the man who prepared a great supper, and "on the 28th Sunday read the sequential one which falls on another Sunday" . If the 28th Sunday falls directly before the Sunday of the Forefathers, then on the Sunday of the Forefathers the 29th sequential Sunday falls, and it is transferred back, to the 28th Sunday. If the 28th Sunday falls directly after the Sunday of the Forefathers, then on the Sunday of the Forefathers the 27th sequential Sunday falls and it is transferred forward, to the 28th Sunday. Similar will be with the Apostle of the 29th sequential Sunday, which will be the same as that of the Sunday of the Forefathers, that is "Brethren, when Christ appears", although the typikon says nothing about this.
ABOUT THE GOSPELS OF THE OTHER 4 SUNDAYS: 29, 30, 31 AND 32
The Gospels of these Sundays are usually combined with the Gospels of the Menaion Sundays that relate to the Nativity of Christ and Theophany, however, not always identically, but more or less, depending on the greater or lesser distance of the Sunday of the Publican from Theophany. This distance will be greater when Pascha falls later and smaller when Pascha falls earlier. For Pascha can fall on one of 35 days: from 22 March to 25 April, both inclusive. The greater distance between Theophany and the Sunday of the Publican, that is the Triodion, will be when Pascha falls on 25 April, for in this case the Sunday of the Publican, the tenth before the Resurrection, falls on 14 February and the distance between Theophany and the Triodion will be 38 days, that is 5 weeks and three days, for, having subtracted 6 days from January, 25 will remain, to them are added 13 days of February, and it will be 38; and dividing by 7, it will be 5 integers and 3 remainder. The smaller distance will be when Pascha falls on 22 March, for then the Sunday of the Publican falls on 11 January, and the distance between Theophany and the Triodion, that is between 6 and 11 January, will be only 4 days, in the number of which there will not be a single Sunday, for the 4 days before the Sunday of the Publican will be weekdays, namely Saturday, Friday, Thursday and Wednesday.
If between Theophany and the Triodion there are 5 Sundays, then immediately after Theophany the Sunday after the Enlightenment is taken, and after it – the 4 last sequential ones: 29th, 30th, 31st and 32nd, for they, in this case, are not combined with the Menaion ones that are in the cycle of the Nativity of Christ and Theophany, but are transferred here to fill the Sundays that are lacking before the Triodion.
If between Theophany and the Triodion there are 4 Sundays, then after Theophany the Sunday after the Enlightenment is taken, and after it – the 3 last sequential ones: 30th, 31st and 32nd.
If between Theophany and the Triodion there are 3 Sundays, then after Theophany the Sunday after the Enlightenment is taken, as well as the sequential 31st and 32nd.
If between Theophany and the Triodion there are 2 Sundays, then after the Sunday after the Enlightenment only the last sequential 32nd, about Zacchaeus, is taken.
If between Theophany and the Triodion there is only one Sunday, then the Sunday after the Enlightenment is taken, and together with it the 32nd about Zacchaeus, which is always taken directly before the Publican .
If between Theophany and the Triodion there is not a single Sunday, then the Sunday after the Enlightenment is combined together with the Sunday of the Publican (and according to the rule of the Greek Evangelistarion it is transferred to 7 January and combined with the Synaxis of the Forerunner), and the 32nd sequential Sunday – together with the Sunday before the Enlightenment .
Note
If the last sequential Sundays are transferred to the Sundays that are lacking between the Sunday after the Enlightenment and the Triodion, then according to the rule of our service book , with the Sunday Gospels the weekday Gospels are also transferred. Therefore, even on the weekdays which belong to the cycle of Menaion Sundays that relate to the Nativity of Christ and to Theophany, the above-mentioned Gospels of the weekday days should be discarded and the Apostle-Gospel of the services of the saints of the menologion or of various services for every need should be read. If someone wants to repeat the past ones, he can repeat any past week, at his own desire, as the Evangelistarion prescribes: Αναποδιζειν δει όπισθεν, και αναγινωσκειν όθεν ύελεις.
Question I: How do we know how many Sundays there will be in a given year between Theophany and the Triodion?
Answer: We learn about this with the help of the boundary key, which is at the end of the Horologion and this typikon, and is given for every year. Having seen which of the 35 boundary keys and which of the 35 Paschal days corresponding to them falls then, we calculate all the days that are between Theophany and the nearest Pascha, and having subtracted from them 10 weeks, that is 70 days, which will be from Pascha back to the Publican, we divide the remainder by 7, and the quotient will give the number of Sundays. If the remainder is not divisible by 7, then there will not be a single one. We give two examples: one, if Pascha falls earlier, and the second – if later.
The earliest Pascha will be 22 March. Between Pascha and Theophany there will be days:
March 21
February 28
January 25
________________________________________
74 - 70 = 4 weekday days, weeks – not a single one.
The latest Pascha will be 25 April. Between Pascha and Theophany there will be days:
April 24
March 31
February 28
January 25
________________________________________
108 - 70 = 38 : 7 = 6 weeks
3 weekday days.
For a better understanding of the aforesaid we present here a table of all boundary keys and the Paschal days corresponding to them and the Sundays between Theophany and the Triodion.
TABLE
BOUNDARY KEYS	PASCHAL DAYS	SUNDAYS BETWEEN THEOPHANY AND TRIODION
1. А. Б. В	March 22.23.24	0
2. Г. Д. Є. Ж. Зіло. 3. Й	March 25.26.27.28.29.30.31	1
3. І. К. Л. М. Н. О. Π	April 1.2.3.4.5.6.7	2
4. Ρ. С. Τ. Іжиця. Φ. Χ. От	April 8.9.10.11.12.13.14	3
5. Ц. Ч. Ш. Щ. Йор. Йори. Ь	April 15.16.17.18.19.20.21	4
6. Ять. Ю. Вел.юс. Я	April 22.23.24.25	5
This table consists of six rows, of which the first two encompass March, and the four last – April. The first row has only three letters, the sixth – only four, and the middle ones – seven each. In the case of the first three letters [keys] between Theophany and the Triodion there will be no Sunday; in the case of the seven letters of the second row – there will be one Sunday; in the case of the third row there will be two Sundays; in the case of the fourth – three Sundays; and in the case of the sixth – five Sundays .
According to this, if you wish to know which Gospel you must take this year 1899 after Theophany before the Triodion, then, having looked at the table of boundary keys, which is at the end of the Horologion or of this typikon, you will find for this year the boundary key "Щ"; also having looked at the table presented here before, you will find this letter in the fifth row, and on the right side of the table – the number "IV". Therefore, between Theophany and the Triodion there will be four Sundays, of which the first will be the Sunday after the Enlightenment, the second – the sequential 30th, the third – the 31st Sunday, the fourth – the 32nd Sunday, which is about Zacchaeus; also the Triodion.
Question 2: How many sequential Sundays can be superfluous, and how many can be lacking before the Triodion?
Answer: The typikons say nothing about this, but note only in general that several can be superfluous, and several lacking; and if they are superfluous it is prescribed to discard them, and if they are lacking, they prescribe to repeat the past ones .
Regarding the superfluous ones, we think that this will never take place. Regarding the lack, we consider that Apostle-Gospels can be lacking at most for five Sundays. To understand this, one must know that Pascha, which follows directly, can fall one or two weeks earlier, or two or three weeks later, than the past one. This conclusion can be made if one compares all the boundary keys of a whole indiction, year after year. Thus, the latest Pascha can fall five weeks later than the previous one, however, with intervals, and not directly from year to year. In that case, if from Pascha to Pascha a whole year ran sequentially, that is 52 weeks, then Apostle-Gospels would be lacking for two Sundays, for they exist only for 50, namely: 18 of the Triodion and 32 outside the Triodion. If, therefore, the following Pascha falls two weeks earlier than the past one, then from Pascha to Pascha only 50 weeks pass and, thus, the number of Apostle-Gospels equals the number of weeks that pass from Pascha to Pascha, for of those too – 50, thus, there will be no superfluous ones. If from Pascha to Pascha 51 weeks pass, then Apostle-Gospels will be lacking for one week, if 53 (52, namely exactly one year, cannot be), then they will be lacking for 3 weeks; if 54, then they will be lacking for four weeks; if 55, then they will be lacking for five weeks. This lack of sequential Sundays can be filled by the Menaion Sundays which belong to the cycle of the Nativity of Christ and Theophany, however, not by all five, but only by four, for the Sunday of the Forefathers and the 28th sequential have the same Gospel, and therefore merge into one Sunday. Therefore one of the past sequential Sundays must be repeated after the Sunday after the Enlightenment.
 
SUNDAY OF THE HOLY FOREFATHERS
Note: This Sunday, the second before the Nativity of Christ, can fall during the course of seven days, from 11 to 17 December inclusive. Therefore it can fall either in the middle of the feast of the Conception, which is given up on 16 December, or outside, namely 17 December. And since the one that is in the middle of the feast can fall with a Saint either without Polyeleos, which usually happens, or with Polyeleos, as on 13 December, when the Service of St. Eustratius, according to our and Russian typikons, is taken with Polyeleos , the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers has three cases: 1. In the middle of the feast (of the Immaculate Conception) with a Saint without Polyeleos; 2. In the middle of the feast with a Saint with Polyeleos; 3. Outside the feast, that is 17 December. Thus, the Sunday of the Forefathers limits the service of a Saint without Polyeleos to Compline, with the exception of the service of 17 December, that is of the Holy Prophet Daniel and the three youths. Although this service is without Polyeleos, nevertheless, because it has a special relationship to the service of the Forefathers, it is combined with the service of the Forefathers. Now we will give the rule for the three above-mentioned cases.
List cases 1-n

2. SUNDAY OF THE HOLY FOREFATHERS
13 December with the service of the Holy Martyrs Eustratius and others
Note
When the service of these martyrs falls on weekdays, then their order will be according to the general rule of a Saint with Polyeleos that falls with Afterfeast on weekdays. If on Sunday, then their service is combined with the Resurrectional and the Forefathers. The service of the Afterfeast is not taken, as in the case of John the Theologian on 8 May, when it falls on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, which is before the Descent. From here we borrow the rule for this case, since the typikon gives nothing. And it will be such:
AT GREAT VESPERS
1.	At "Lord, I have cried" – 10 stichera: 3 Resurrectional, 4 to the Forefathers and 3 to the Martyrs, Glory: of the Forefathers, Both now: 1st Theotokion of the tone.

SUNDAY OF THE HOLY FATHERS BEFORE THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST
Note
This Sunday can fall on one of seven days, starting from 18 to 24 December.

Furthermore, if this Sunday falls on the last day of the Forefeast, that is 24 December, on the very Eve of the Nativity of Christ, then it has a separate rule.

20–24 DECEMBER Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ
The Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ covers five days, of Theophany – four. The divine service is celebrated according to the general rule of the Forefeast of the Lord, with the following exceptions:
AT VESPERS
At "Lord, I have cried", on Saturday evening on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, instead of the 1st Theotokion (Dogmatikon), a stichera of the Forefeast is taken. Likewise on the Apodosis of the Nativity of Christ; if it falls on a Sunday – a stichera of the Feast is taken .
AT COMPLINE
From 20 December to 14 January, that is until the Apodosis of Theophany, the Octoechos canon to the Theotokos is not taken; in the Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ and Theophany the canon of the Forefeast is taken: sometimes one three-ode canon (22, 23 December), sometimes one three-ode canon and a second two-ode canon with it (20 December, 2 January); sometimes two three-ode canons (3 January), sometimes an eight-ode canon (22, 24 December, 4, 5 January). These canons are taken thus: if there is only one canon, then the irmoi of each of its odes are taken twice each, troparia on 6 and, again the same irmos once for conclusion (instead of Katavasia); if there are two canons, then only the irmoi of the first canon are taken twice each, and the irmoi of the second canon are taken only once, and this only at the end of each ode; troparia of both canons together on 6. The refrain to the troparia of the canon will be: "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", "Glory" – on the penultimate, "Both now" – on the last, only instead of "Glory" at the 8th ode, we sing: "Let us bless the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Lord" ; and to the Katavasia we sing: "We praise, we bless" and the rest, as at Matins. The Katavasia is sung by both choirs together with a bow at its end, at the 8th and 9th odes; also after the irmos of the 9th ode, before the troparia, a bow is prescribed . Otherwise at the 3rd, 6th and 9th odes the canon has nothing. After the canon – either "It is truly meet", as the Moscow Typikon gives on 20 December, or only the irmos of the 9th ode, as the Pochaiv and Lviv Trefologia give on 2 January.
AT MATINS: Stichera of the Praises of the Forefeast on 4, Small Doxology and further, in its place, also the Aposticha .
AT THE HOURS
Nothing special, except Great Hours, called Royal, on the Eve of the Nativity and Theophany, if they fall on one of the fast days, starting from Monday to Friday, or on Friday before the Eve, if it falls on Saturday or on Sunday.
AT THE LITURGY
Nothing special, except the Liturgy of Basil the Great with Vespers of the Feast on the Eve of the Nativity and Theophany, if they fall on one of the five fast days, from Monday to Friday. For if they fall on Saturday or on Sunday, then on the Eve there will be the Liturgy of Chrysostom, at its proper time without Vespers, and afterwards – Vespers of the Feast, at its proper time. On the Feast itself – Liturgy of Basil the Great without Vespers. On Friday, before the Eve, to which the Royal Hours are transferred, the typikon gives no Liturgy, this is adhered to also by the Lviv Synod .
Saturday before the Nativity of Christ
in the middle of the Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ
See the rule on p. 154.
 
24 DECEMBER Eve of the Nativity of Christ
Everything – according to the rule given above for the Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, however, instead of the usual Hours we sing the Great Hours and the Liturgy of Basil with Vespers. Only, if the Eve falls on Saturday or on Sunday, we sing the Hours before that, on Friday, and the Liturgy of Basil – on the very day of the Feast. On the Eve – Liturgy of Chrysostom, at its proper time, and afterwards – Vespers, at its proper time.
HOURS
OF THE EVE OF THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST AND THEOPHANY
Notes
1.	The Lviv Synod orders pastors to celebrate these Hours together with the Typika in church, in violet vestments, in view of the fast , in bright vestments it is celebrated before Theophany only when the Hours from Saturday or Sunday are transferred back, to Friday, for then there is no fast, but it will be a general dispensation.
2.	Now we sing all the Hours adding "The Typika" (Obidnytsia); and therefore we begin the Hours 3rd, 6th and 9th from "O come, let us worship", and we make the dismissal only at the end of "The Typika".
3.	These Hours are celebrated in the morning, earlier or later, at the decision of the superior; according to the custom of the arch-cathedral church – at 9 o'clock before noon , so that there would be a certain distance between the Hours and the Liturgy, which according to the custom of the same church begins at 11 o'clock. If the Hours begin earlier, then the Liturgy can also begin earlier, but since it is celebrated with Vespers, it should begin around 10 o'clock, as the Lviv Synod decreed about Vespers with the Presanctified .
4.	The composition and form of the Great Hours is the same as of the usual Hours, with the exception of three troparia and three readings, given after the Theotokion "What shall we call thee" at the 1st Hour and after the corresponding ones at the other Hours. Regarding the essence, the Royal Hours differ from the usual ones also by the tripalm, which at the Royal Hours is special, appropriate to the given feast .
5.	In the temple, before the Holy Doors, opposite the people, two analogia are placed, on the first of which the Gospel is placed; the second, slightly lower, – opposite the Holy Doors, from which the Paremia and Apostle are to be read. Where there is no analogion for the Gospel, it lies on the Holy Table and is brought out by the Priest through the Holy Doors only for reading, and is supported by servers .
6.	The Royal Hours are celebrated with the Holy Doors closed, which are opened only for the reading of the Gospel.
7.	Candles on the altar are lit only for the reading of the Gospel.
RULE
At the appointed time the priest enters the temple and, having approached the Holy Table and having bowed low, kisses the Gospel, marks four Gospel readings and, having bowed again, goes out to the sacristy; puts on an epitrachelion, goes out before the closed Holy Doors, makes a low bow to the Holy Mysteries and begins the usual: "Blessed is our God". Choir: "Amen", also "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", "O Heavenly King" and everything else, as usual, up to "O come, let us worship" inclusive . At the second "O come, let us worship" the priest, having bowed low, enters the sanctuary and, while the choirs sing the tripalm, reads it sitting in his place.
When, after the Troparion of the Forefeast "Once Mary was registered", the Theotokion is also read, the choirs sing three stichera idiomesa  on 6, that is twice each. The first stichera both the first and the second time is sung without a refrain; the second – the first time with a separate refrain, and the second – with another separate refrain; the third – the first time with the refrain "Glory", and the second – with the refrain "Both now". All four above-mentioned refrains at all Hours – are the same. At the 9th Hour the third stichera is taken three times, that is the first time it is read loudly and piously by the canonarch in the middle of the church, without a refrain, then the second time – by one choir with the refrain "Glory", and the third – by the other with the refrain "Both now" .
After the singing of the three stichera there will be three readings: the first – of the Prophecy with a Prokeimenon, the second – of the Apostle without a Prokeimenon and without Alleluia, the third – of the Gospel, beginning it from "Wisdom, attend!", "Let us hear". All this is accompanied by the following actions: when the stichera end, the priest puts on a phelonion and, having gone out before the steps of the altar and having bowed, opens the Holy Doors and exclaims: "Let us attend! Peace be unto all!" (blessing the people), "Wisdom! Let us attend!". The choirs sing the Prokeimenon. After its conclusion the priest, having exclaimed before the title of the Prophecy "Wisdom!" and before the reading "Let us attend!", waits before the steps of the altar for the end of the reading of the Prophecy and, after its conclusion, having exclaimed "Wisdom!" and "Let us attend!" before the reading of the Apostle, as usual, puts incense into the censer with the short prayer "Incense we offer to Thee" and, having blessed the incense with the words "Blessed is our God", censes everything as usual, that is the Holy Table from four sides, the iconostasis, the choirs and the people . At the end of the Apostle, and together with it the censing, the candle-bearers go out before the analogion, and the priest approaches the Holy Table and, having bowed, takes the Holy Gospel and, having placed it on the analogion, begins to sing the Gospel from "Wisdom, attend". After the singing of the Gospel the priest, having kissed the beginning of the reading, leaves it there, closes the Holy Doors and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, goes out to the sacristy, takes off the phelonion, goes out through the side doors before the Holy Doors for "Thou Who at all times" and remains there until the end of the Hour.
Note: Since we sing all the Hours together, the prayer of blessing the incense should be said only at the 1st Hour, at the others – only "Blessed is our God" just as at Great Vespers with All-Night Vigil.
If there be deacons, they put on dalmatics with an orarion before the beginning of the 1st Hour and remain vested until the end of the Typika. At the Prokeimenon, together with the priest, they go before the steps of the altar and, having bowed low all together to the Holy Mysteries, open the Holy Doors. The right deacon exclaims: "Let us attend!", and the left, after the giving of peace by the priest: "Wisdom! Let us attend!". Also before the first and second reading – the right: "Wisdom!", and the left: "Let us attend!" and they cense everything as usual, as at the beginning of the Liturgy. At the end of the Apostle, and together with it the censing, both deacons stand with the priest before the steps of the altar and, having bowed all three together to the Holy Mysteries, go out from the sanctuary: the priest with the Gospel through the middle [doors], and the deacons, having swapped their sides, through the side doors to the analogion. The right deacon exclaims: "Wisdom, attend!", "Let us hear", the priest: "The reading from the Holy Gospel according to (Name)", and the left deacon: "Let us attend!". The priest sings the Gospel. Having finished, the priest kisses the beginning of the reading, also the right deacon, and after him the left. Having bowed low, the deacons return through their doors to the sanctuary and, together with the priest, close the Holy Doors. Having bowed low all three together to the Holy Mysteries, they withdraw: the deacons to their places, and the priest before the iconostasis for "Thou Who at all times".
If the hierarch or other sacred dignitaries be present in the church, the deacons should cense them before the choirs, and neither the priest nor the deacons should kiss the Gospel before the hierarch and sacred dignitaries, and therefore both deacons together carry the open Gospel to them for kissing, also to the priest standing in the Holy Doors and, when he kisses it, the deacons themselves kiss [it], after which they place it on the analogion and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, return, each through his doors, to the sanctuary.
Question: When the Royal Hours are transferred from Sunday or Saturday back, to Friday, should one take on them the Troparion of the Eve or of the Forefeast, 22 or 23 December?
Answer: The Typikon mentions the Troparion and Kontakion of the Eve, therefore we think that one should take [those] of the Eve. If someone thinks that this will not be good and takes one Troparion for two days, that is on the Eve and before the Eve, let him consider that the Troparion of the Forefeast is also taken the same on two different days of the Forefeast.
THE TYPIKA (OBIDNYTSIA)
After the concluding prayer of the 9th Hour we immediately read the Typika just as in the Horologion, however, without the introductory verse that is before the first psalm, without the stichera on the "Beatitudes", without the Apostle-Gospel; also, if there be Liturgy, then also without the "Creed" and without "Blessed be the name of the Lord", and without the following 33rd Psalm, for all this will be taken at the Liturgy. When the Royal Hours are transferred back, to Friday, then since then there will be no Liturgy, here both the "Creed" and "Blessed be the name of the Lord" with the 33rd Psalm is read. Instead of the kontakia of the temple, of the day and others, one Kontakion of the Eve is taken. Here is the detailed rule for you.
DETAILED RULE
1.	After the concluding prayer of the 9th Hour the priest, having bowed before the Holy Doors, enters the sanctuary and sits in his place.
2.	The choirs read: Psalm 102 "Bless the Lord, O my soul" and Psalm 145 "Praise the Lord, O my soul", "Glory, Both now", "Only-begotten Son".
3.	The Beatitudes: "In Thy kingdom ... great in heaven", "Glory, Both now".
4.	"Remember us, O Lord" (3).
5.	"The heavenly choir", verse "Come unto Him", "The heavenly choir", Glory: "The choir of holy angels", Both now: "Remit, pardon" (when there is no Liturgy, then Both now: "The Creed", also "Remit, forgive").
6.	"Our Father", Kontakion of the Eve once and "Lord, have mercy" (12).
7.	The priest goes out before the Holy Doors in an epitrachelion, reads the prayer "O All-Holy Trinity" (if there be Liturgy, then the choir immediately: "It is truly meet" and the rest; if not, then before "It is truly meet" the choir sings: "Blessed be the name of the Lord" (3) and Psalm "I will bless the Lord", and the priest then waits before the Holy Doors until the end).
8.	Choir: "It is truly meet" with "More honorable than the Cherubim".
Priest: "Glory to Thee, O Christ God".
Choir: "Glory, Both now", "Lord, have mercy" (3), "Master, bless".

25 DECEMBER Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ
Note
The service of the very day of the feast of the Nativity of Christ (as also of Theophany) departs from the general rules of a Feast of the Lord in the following points:
1.	Its Vespers on the Eve is combined with the Service of Basil, if the Eve falls on one of the first five weekdays, starting from Monday.
2.	On this feast two Vespers are not celebrated: one Small at its proper time, and the second Great at the All-Night Vigil with Matins, as on other feasts, but one, Great, either with the Service of Basil, if the Eve falls on one of the five fast days of the week, or separately at its proper time, if it falls on Saturday or Sunday. All-Night Vigil is served with Great Compline.
3.	Vespers of this feast will be either with the Service of Basil, or separately, as on Saturday or on Sunday. It is never served completely, but, if it be with the Service, only until the end of the readings, after which the Small Litany is exclaimed and the exclamation of the Trisagion; and from here, according to the order, the Service of Basil. If it be separately, then only until the end of the litany "Let us complete", that is until the end of its second exclamation ("For Thine is the kingdom"), because the Aposticha and everything else is taken at the All-Night Vigil after the Litya.
4.	Vespers has not only 3 readings, as on other feasts, but 8 (on Theophany – 11); therefore, after the first three and after the second three readings, it has a separate troparion with its verses.
5.	Compline is served only until the end of "Glory to God in the highest" and immediately the Litya begins with the blessing of loaves and everything else, as at the All-Night Vigil with Vespers.
6.	Theophany has the Great Blessing of Water directly after Vespers; also, according to our custom, more solemnly – on the very day of the feast, after the Prayer behind the Ambo.
7.	On the Eve of the Nativity of Christ and Theophany, when there is to be the Service of Basil with Vespers, the Lviv Synod forbids read services. If several priests wish to serve, it orders them to sing only one service in the cathedral (Title IV, chap. I, part 5).
8.	In the arch-cathedral church Vespers with the Service of Basil begins at 10.30. If the Eve falls on Saturday or on Sunday, then the Service of Chrysostom without Vespers will be at 08.30, and Vespers separately begins at 11.00, in order to hasten the Holy Supper, which according to the typikon should begin later, that is at 3 o'clock in the afternoon (current 1 o'clock after noon) on the Eve of the Nativity, and on the Eve of Theophany – in the evening hours, that is at the usual time. All-Night Vigil with Compline – at the usual time . Now we will give three detailed rules: one – for the case of Vespers with the Service of Basil, one – for the case of Vespers which is celebrated separately, without the Service, and one – for the All-Night Vigil with Great Compline.
RULE
1. VESPERS WITH THE SERVICE OF BASIL
with the Eve on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
1.	From the beginning to "Blessed is the Kingdom" everything is exactly as usual at the Service without Vespers .

The deacons, if there be [any], remain at the Holy Doors and from here exclaim according to the order "Wisdom" and "Let us attend" with the lifting of the orarion towards the people, as the order of All-Night Vigil prescribes.
8.	There will be 8 readings, and on Theophany – 11. After the first three and the second three readings of both feasts there will be a separate troparion with its verses; there will be three of them , besides "Glory, Both now", for the whole troparion is sung only twice, namely: once before the first verse and once before the last verse, that is before "Both now", and after the other verses – only up to the half .

2. VESPERS WITHOUT THE SERVICE
with the Eve on Saturday or on Sunday
Note: In this case there will be the Service of Chrysostom at its proper time, without Vespers, according to the rule given before on p. 154, if Saturday, and on p. 159, if Sunday; Vespers at its proper time thus:
1.	The priest, having put on an epitrachelion and having gone out before the Holy Doors, bows low and begins the usual: "Blessed is our God". Choirs: "Amen", also "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", "O Heavenly King" and the rest with the Trisagion and "Our Father" up to "O come, let us worship" inclusive. Deacons, if there be [any], go out with the priest before the Holy Doors and the right one of them exclaims: "Bless, Master", and the priest: "Blessed is our God" .
2.	During the introductory Psalm the priest, standing before the Holy Doors, says the evening prayers, as usual, and the deacons stand beside him and, at the end of the Psalm, one of them (the right) sings the Great Litany, and the priest – its exclamation, and then, all bow low and withdraw to the sanctuary. If there be no deacons, then the priest himself sings the litany.
3.	"Blessed is the man" and the Small Litany, for which the second deacon goes out before the Holy Doors, and the priest – the exclamation from his place. If there be no deacon, then the priest himself, according to local custom, reads the litany quietly, sitting in his place, and the choir sings its responses.
4.	At "Lord, I have cried" – usual censing, which the priest or deacons, if there be [any], perform; stichera on 8, "Glory, Both now" from the Irmologion or according to the tone of the idiomesa.
5.	At "Glory, Both now" – Entrance with the Gospel, which the first deacon carries, if there be one, and the second precedes him with the censer; the priest says the usual Prayer of the Entrance, as at Vespers, and blesses the Entrance, as at the Liturgy.
6.	At the end of the stichera the deacon exclaims, if there be one, if – not, then the priest himself: "Wisdom, attend", lifting up the Gospel, and while "O Gladsome Light" is sung, the priest or deacon carrying the Gospel goes out, and behind them the priest, through the middle doors to the sanctuary and, having placed the Gospel on the Holy Table, censes everything as usual and stands before the steps of the Holy Table.
7.	After the singing of "O Gladsome Light" the priest exclaims with the deacons, if there be [any]: "Let us attend! Peace be unto all!", "Wisdom", "Let us attend" and, while the Prokeimenon of the day is sung, the priest withdraws behind the Holy Table, and the deacons remain near the Holy Doors, exclaiming "Wisdom" and "Let us attend" to all the readings, of which on the Nativity of Christ there will be 8, and on Theophany – 11, with a separate troparion and its verses after the first three and after the second three readings.
8.	At the end of the readings the priest returns before the steps of the Holy Table or the first deacon, if there be one, enters before the Holy Doors, where he sings the Small Litany; the priest – the exclamation of the Trisagion, but the Trisagion is not sung, but immediately after the exclamation there will be "Let us attend! Peace be unto all!", "Wisdom", "Let us attend" and the Prokeimenon of the Feast is sung; after "Wisdom" and "Let us attend" – Apostle to the Galatians, zaspiv 201 "I speak after the manner of men"; Gospel according to Matthew, zaspiv 83 "The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed"  (on Theophany: to the Corinthians, zaspiv 143 from the half "Brethren, I would not have you ignorant"; Gospel according to Luke, zaspiv 9 "Now in the fifteenth year"). The Gospel is read by the priest himself  from the Holy Doors, and the first of the deacons, if there be [any], exclaims: "Wisdom, attend! Let us hear the Holy Gospel"; priest: "The reading from the Holy Gospel according to (Name)"; and the second: "Let us attend".
9.	After the singing of the Gospel the priest, having kissed the beginning of the Gospel reading and having given [it] to the first deacon to kiss, also to the second, approaches the Holy Table, on which he places the Holy Gospel, which remains there. The deacons, having bowed low before the steps of the Holy Table, go out, each through HIS doors, before the Holy Doors and, having bowed low, first the second deacon exclaims "Let us all say", and also the first after "Vouchsafe" – the litany "Let us complete". If there be no deacons, then the priest himself sings the litanies from the Holy Table and immediately after the second exclamation of the litany "Let us complete" gives the Great Dismissal of the Feast itself. (On Theophany there is no dismissal here, but it will be after the Blessing of Water).
10.	After the Dismissal both choirs gather together in the middle of the church and sing the Troparion, Glory, Both now: Kontakion of the Feast, and at the end the sacred ministers close the Holy Doors and, having bowed low, withdraw to the sacristy.
ALL-NIGHT VIGIL WITH GREAT COMPLINE
1.	At the usual time of the All-Night Vigil the priest puts on an epitrachelion, and the deacons, if there be [any], – dalmatics with an orarion and go before the steps of the Holy Table and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, open the Holy Doors and the deacons cense everything exactly as at the All-Night Vigil with Vespers .
2.	After the censing the priest (after the deacon, if there be one, exclaims: "Bless, Master") begins: "Blessed is our God"; the choirs sing "Amen", and the sacred ministers, having closed the Holy Doors, stand before the steps of the Holy Table. The choirs continue: "Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee", "O Heavenly King" and the rest with the Trisagion and "Our Father" up to "O come, let us worship". Then the sacred ministers, having bowed low, withdraw behind the Holy Table and sit there in their places.
3.	After the end of the second tripalm the choirs sing alternatingly "God is with us", that is selected verses of the eighth ode of the prophecies of Isaiah. They sing thus: 1st choir: "God is with us, understand ye nations, ... for God is with us", afterwards the second choir sings the same. Also other verses the choirs sing alternatingly, ending each verse with the words "For God is with us". After the end of all verses they sing "God is with us" three times . The custom of singing the whole first verse after each of the following ones as is usually done here, we do not find in any typikon . The Lviv Synod also adds that the priest should not go out before the Holy Doors and sing these verses alternatingly with the choirs, but only there/, where there will be only one choir, for then the priest replaces one of the choirs. Similarly he should not go out for the moleben verses "O Most Holy Lady", which the choirs say twice, that is once one, and once the other choir, but only, if there be one choir .
4.	Instead of the troparia of the day, given after the moleben verses "O Most Holy Lady", the Troparion of the Feast is sung; and instead of the troparia "Have mercy on us, O Lord", given after the Trisagion, which is after the Prayer of Manasses, the Kontakion of the Feast is sung.
5.	The priest goes out before the Holy Doors for three prayers: of Basil, of Manasses and the second of Basil.
6.	After "Glory to God in the highest" the priest, having put on a phelonion, opens the Holy Doors and there will be Litya and everything else until the end of Matins exactly as at the All-Night Vigil with Vespers.
AT THE HOURS AND AT THE LITURGY
Everything – to the Feast. Instead of the Trisagion, we sing at the Liturgy "As many as have been baptized into Christ".
Note: "It will be reasonable also that from the Nativity of Christ until Theophany there will be no fast whatsoever nor kneeling either in church, or in cells" (Menaion at the end of 24 December) . However, our people adhere to the custom of keeping the fast on the Eve of Theophany, as another rule of the Menaion on the Eve of Theophany gives, and also on these days to kneel in church, just as throughout the whole year.
 
26 DECEMBER Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos
and of St. Joseph the Betrothed
and of the Holy Hieromartyr Euthymius
Notes
1.	The Service of the Hieromartyr is sung at Compline on another day.
2.	St. Joseph has nothing in the divine service, except one troparion and kontakion, and this only in our horologia and service books. And the Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos also has almost nothing. Vespers of this feast has an entrance not for the sake of the Synaxis, but for the sake of the Great Prokeimenon of the Feast. Matins from the beginning to the canon – of small type, from the canon to the end – of great type.
3.	Although the divine service of this day, as also of the following, does not have All-Night Vigil, as also Polyeleos, however, our custom, approved by the Synod of Zamość (Titolo de Jeiuniis et Festis) /On fast and feasts/ and Lviv (Title IV, chap. 6) orders during the first three days of this feast to abstain from heavy work and to participate in the divine service; to these days belong: 25, 26 and 27 December.
4.	The Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos has three cases; it can fall: 1) on a weekday, except Monday; 2) on Monday; 3) on Sunday. The reason that the Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos has a separate rule for Monday is that in this case the service of the Synaxis is combined with the service of the Sunday after the Nativity, namely of the Holy Kinsmen of God, King David, Joseph the Betrothed and James, the Brother of the Lord. If, therefore, the Synaxis falls on Monday, then the Sunday after the Nativity would fall on 1 January, that is already after the Apodosis of the Feast, which will be 31 December; therefore, according to the typikon, it is transferred back, to 26 December. We will give the rule for all three above-mentioned cases.

Between the Nativity and Theophany there can be:
1.	One Saturday and one Sunday.
2.	Two Saturdays and one Sunday.
3.	One Saturday and two Sundays.
4.	Two Saturdays and two Sundays.
This discrepancy regarding the number of Saturdays depends on the day of the week on which the Nativity of Christ falls, as follows from the following table:
TABLE OF SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS

If the Nativity of Christ falls on Sunday or Monday, then between the Nativity and Theophany there will be one Saturday and one Sunday, as you will see in the 1st and 3rd transverse rows of weekly letters.
If the Nativity of Christ falls on Tuesday, then there will be two Saturdays and one Sunday, as you will see in the 3rd row.
If the Nativity of Christ on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, then there will be two Saturdays and two Sundays, as you will see in the 4th, 5th and 6th rows.
If the Nativity of Christ on Saturday, then there will be one Saturday and two Sundays, as you will see in the 7th row.
Now, if you wish to know how many Saturdays and Sundays there will be in a given year between the Nativity and Theophany, then first of all you must find out on which day of the week the Nativity of Christ falls, afterwards, going along the transverse line from that day of the week to Theophany, you will find the number of Saturdays and Sundays between the Nativity and Theophany. Regarding the rule which will be for these Saturdays and Sundays in the case when there will be two Saturdays and two Sundays (as in the 4th, 5th and 6th rows), there will be no inconsistency, as there will be no inconsistency in the case when either two Saturdays, or two Sundays (as in the 3rd and 7th rows), for these two Saturdays and two Sundays have their unchangeable rule. But all inconsistencies are limited to the case of only one Saturday or Sunday (as in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th rows). In this case two questions arise:
1.	Which of the two Saturdays or Sundays to take? after the Nativity or before Theophany?
2.	What to do with the second Saturday or Sunday, which then has no place?
To the first question we answer: if this Saturday or Sunday is in the middle of the feast of the Nativity, that is within December, then the Saturday or Sunday after the Nativity is taken; if – outside the feast of the Nativity, that is within January, then the Saturday or Sunday before Theophany is taken. Regarding the second question, that is what to do with one Saturday or Sunday which sometimes has no place, we answer: Greek books give no rule for this and therefore this Saturday or Sunday should not have been taken. However, the Slavs do not wish to discard anything and give the following rules for this case.
RULE FOR SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS
between the Nativity of Christ and Theophany
SATURDAY
The Saturday, which will be the one between the Nativity and Theophany can fall either in the middle, or outside the feast of the Nativity: in the middle, namely 30 or 31 December so, as in the first and second rows; outside the feast, namely 1 January, as in the 7th row. If, therefore, it falls in the middle of the feast, then the Apostle-Gospel will be first of the Saturday after the Nativity, and after – of the Saturday before Theophany. Prokeimenon, Alleluia and Communion Hymn on 30 December will be only of the Saturday after the Nativity; on 31 December, that is on the Apodosis of the feast – will be only of the Feast. If, therefore, it falls outside the feast, as in the 6th row, that is 1 January, then the Apostle-Gospel will be first to the Circumcision, for the Saturday does not have them. On Saturday after the Nativity the Apostle-Gospel is taken on the Apodosis of the feast, 31 December. Prokeimenon, Alleluia and Communion Hymn – only of the Feast.
SUNDAY
If there be one Sunday between the Nativity and Theophany, then, similarly as for Saturday, it falls either in the middle of the feast, that is 30 or 31 December, as in the 3rd and 2nd rows, or outside the feast, that is 1 January with the Circumcision, as in the 1st row. And if it falls in the middle of the feast, then the Sunday after the Nativity is taken on 30 or 31 December according to the rule given here on p. 182-183. And the Sunday before Theophany is taken on 1 January in the first place, also the Circumcision and everything else according to the rule which is given for 1 January, when it falls on a Sunday. If the Sunday is one and falls on 1 January, as in the 1st row, then the Sunday after the Nativity is taken on 26 December with the Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos according to the rule given here on p. 181 .


 
26 DECEMBER St. Protomartyr Stephen
and Venerable Theodore
The Service of these Saints – without Polyeleos, according to the general rule of two saints on 4 in the Afterfeast, although in the Pochaiv Trefologion the Service of St. Stephen is given with Polyeleos. One peculiarity of this day – at Matins, for St. Protomartyr (according to others also the Feast) has both Stichera of the Praises, and afterwards – Small Doxology, and Aposticha in its place. Finally our people even on this day abstain from work and take part in the divine service.

JANUARY
1 JANUARY Circumcision of the Lord and memory of St. Basil the Great

In general typikons the divine service of this day is not given with All-Night Vigil, but only with Polyeleos. However, probably for the sake of the beginning of the civil year, or also for Basil the Great, for many years All-Night Vigil has been served with us, because it is already given in the Pochaiv Trefologion of 1777 . We will present the rule first for weekdays, and then for Sunday.

Everything according to the rule of the feast of the Nativity of Christ, here on p. 168-175, with the exception of the Blessing of Water, which here takes place after Vespers or after the Prayer behind the Ambo, if Vespers be with the Service of Basil, and on the next day – after the Prayer behind the Ambo, as is given below.
RITE OF THE GREAT BLESSING OF WATER
RULE
After the Prayer behind the Ambo, if Saturday or Sunday, then after the dismissal of Vespers, the church cross-bearer stands between two candle-bearers in the middle of the church, and before him – a church server with three candlesticks, with a censer and with a vessel for incense. The deacon takes the Holy Gospel from the table, the priest takes the cross with his right hand and, having bowed low to the Holy Mysteries, they go out through the Holy Doors: first the deacon with the Gospel, behind him – the priest with the cross, vested in all sacred vestments of his rank, and the choir sings the Troparion "The voice of the Lord" ; all proceed to the narthex of the church. When all have gone out there, the deacon places the Holy Gospel, and the priest – the cross on a table covered with a tablecloth or a clean cloth, on which there will be also a wide vessel with water; and immediately the priest censes the table from four sides and all present, according to the order.
After the end of the troparia follow three readings of prophecies; also the Apostle with its Prokeimenon and Alleluia, during the singing of which the deacons cense the water from four sides of the tetrapod, the priest and all present, according to the order. Then the priest reads the Gospel, before which the first deacon exclaims: "Wisdom, attend" and the rest, and the second: "Let us attend".
After the singing of the Gospel the deacon says the litany "In peace let us pray to the Lord", during which the priest reads quietly the prayer "O Lord Jesus Christ"; and after the prayer he does not exclaim, but says to himself: "Amen". And when "For the precipitous, pure" is said, the priest begins loudly this prayer: "Great art Thou, O Lord" . The prayer "O Trinity beyond all being", since it is given only in some editions, may be omitted; this is allowed by the Euchologion of Benedict, although our typikons do not allow this .
In the prayer "Great art Thou, O Lord" three members are exclaimed three times, namely the first member "Great art Thou, O Lord", at which the priest three times crosswise signs the water with three lit candles ; the second "Thou Thyself, therefore", at which he blesses the water with his hand, immersing his fingers crosswise; the third "Thou Thyself and now", at which he breathes three times crosswise on the water. When he exclaims: "And save, O Lord, Thy servants, the Most Holy Ecumenical Primate (Name) the Pope of Rome  and our faithful Emperor (Name)" the choir sings "Many Years".
At the end of this prayer the choir: "Amen"; priest: "Peace be unto all" and, after the prayer at the bowing of heads, which he says quietly, he exclaims: "For Thou art the sanctification" and immediately blesses with the cross: immerses it simply into the water, holding with both hands, and sings this troparion: "When in Jordan" , and all the people sing with him. "And the second time singing the same troparion" , and all the people sing with him. Then the server pours holy water onto a tray or into a sprinkler. The priest turns his face to the west, holding the precious cross with his left hand, and with the right – the sprinkler, and sprinkles all the people with holy water. After this the choirs sing Glory, Both now: Stichera "Let us praise, O faithful", the procession returns to the church in the same way, and the priest sprinkles on all sides , and thus they enter the sanctuary through the Holy Doors: the deacon with the Gospel, and after him the priest with the cross. And when the priest has sprinkled the entire sanctuary, the deacon places the Gospel, and the priest the cross on the Holy Table, in its place, and the choir sings "Blessed be the name of the Lord", if there be Vespers with the Service of Basil; if Vespers – separate from the Holy Liturgy, then immediately the Great Dismissal of the Feast; at the end: Troparion, Glory, Both now: Kontakion of the Feast, which both choirs sing together in the middle of the church, as at Vespers with the Service of Basil on 25 December.
Note: The Lviv Synod orders pastors to perform this blessing of water in their churches both on the Eve, and, more solemnly, on the very day of the Feast (Title IV, Chapter IV, part 2).
AT THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL, AT THE HOURS AND AT THE LITURGY
Everything according to the rule of 25 December on p. 173-175.

17 JANUARY
Our Venerable Father Anthony the Great
20 JANUARY
Our Venerable Father Euthymius the Great
25 JANUARY
Our Holy Father Gregory the Theologian
27 JANUARY
Translation of the relics of Saint John Chrysostom
Note
In January fall five saints, whose memory we honor with Polyeleos without All-Night Vigil, that is 11 January – Ven. Theodosius, 17 January – Anthony the Great, 20 January – Euthymius the Great, 25 January – Gregory the Theologian, 27 January – Translation of the relics of Chrysostom, and since the Triodion can begin within the limits of 35 days, from 11 January to 14 February, therefore these saints can fall either outside, or in the middle of the Triodion: in the middle of the Triodion, if the beginning of the Triodion falls on one of the days from 11 to 27 January; outside the Triodion, if the beginning of the Triodion falls on one of the days from 28 January to 14 February. And if they fall outside the Triodion, then their services are subject to the general rule of a Saint with Polyeleos; if they fall in the middle of the Triodion, they should have a separate rule, and since church books do not give it, we will give it.
VARIOUS CASES REGARDING THESE SAINTS
Of the above-mentioned five saints, St. Theodosius can fall only with one service of the Triodion, that is with the service of the Sunday of the Publican; and since in this case at the Liturgy it would be necessary to take three Apostles and three Gospels: of the Sunday after Theophany, of the Sunday of the Publican and of the Saint, then, to avoid this, Slavic typikons transfer the service of the venerable one to another day.
St. Anthony can fall only with the service of the Sunday of the Publican, but is not transferred, for he does not coincide with the Sunday after Theophany.
St. Euthymius can fall not only with the Sunday of the Publican, but also with the Sunday of the Prodigal [Son]. If the Sunday of the Publican falls on 13 January, then the Sunday of the Prodigal [Son] will be on 20 January, that is together with St. Euthymius.
St. Gregory and Chrysostom can fall not only with the Sunday of the Publican and of the Prodigal [Son], but also with the Meatfare, for when the Triodion begins on 18 or 20 January, then the Sunday of the Prodigal [Son] will be 25 or 27 January, and when the Triodion begins on 11 or 13 January, then 25 or 27 January will be Meatfare Sunday. These saints can fall also on the Saturday of Souls, that is Meatfare, which precedes Meatfare Sunday. If the Triodion begins on 12 or 14 January, then 25 or 27 falls on Meatfare Saturday. Chrysostom can fall also on Cheesefare Tuesday, which will be after Meatfare Sunday, for if 25 January falls on Meatfare Sunday, then 27 January will be Cheesefare Tuesday.
RULE
If one of these saints falls outside the Triodion, one should adhere to the general rule of a Saint with Polyeleos. If he falls in the middle of the Triodion, as e.g. St. Theodosius can fall on the Sunday of the Publican, he must be transferred to another day. If one of the four other saints falls on the Sunday of the Publican, of the Prodigal [Son], Meatfare, on Meatfare Saturday or on Cheesefare Tuesday, then one must adhere to the rule of the Three Hierarchs, given in the Menaion on 30 January, which we will give immediately, with the exception of the All-Night Vigil, which will not be here, but there will be it at Great Vespers, at the end. Resurrectional Troparion, Glory: of the Saint, Both now: Resurrectional Theotokion according to the tone of the Saint. At Compline, after "It is truly meet" – Kontakion of the Saint, Glory, Both now: Kontakion of the Triodion .
30 JANUARY Three Hierarchs
Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom,
and the Holy Hieromartyr Hippolytus
Note
The Service of the Hieromartyr is sung on another day at Compline; the service of the Hierarchs is sung on this day, according to the general rule of a Saint with All-Night Vigil ; it departs from the general rule of a Saint with All-Night Vigil only in that at Matins, instead of "More honorable", it has separate refrains, as on feasts of the Theotokos. However, if their service falls within the limits of the Triodion, then it is combined with the service of the Triodion, and therefore has separate rules.
Triodion services, with which it can fall:
1.	Sunday of the Publican, of the Prodigal [Son] and Meatfare.
2.	Meatfare Saturday (of Souls).
3.	Cheesefare Monday, Tuesday or Thursday.
4.	Cheesefare Wednesday or Friday. We give the rule for all these cases.

Note
Our and Russian church rules do not give for this case All-Night Vigil, and consequently neither Small Vespers, but only one Great, without blessing of loaves; afterwards also Compline, at which after "It is truly meet" – Kontakion of the Saints. All this according to the rule of the Forerunner on 24 February . However, since with us even in this case All-Night Vigil is served, although there is no rule for it, we will give the rule of the All-Night Vigil also for this case, similarly to the rule of the Meeting on 2 February, if it falls on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday of Cheesefare week.
RULE AT SMALL VESPERS
Everything – as outside the Triodion, only at the Aposticha – stichera idiomesa of the day of the Triodion twice and to the Martyrs, Glory: of the Saints, Both now: their Theotokion.
AT GREAT VESPERS, AT MATINS,
AT THE HOURS AND AT THE LITURGY
Everything, as outside the Triodion, only at Matins, at the Praises there will be Glory: of the Triodion, Both now: of the Triodion.
Note
If the Three Hierarchs fall on one of the days of Cheesefare week, then the three-ode canon of Matins we sing at Compline, namely: if the Feast is on Monday, then at Compline on Sunday; if on Tuesday, then on Wednesday; if on Wednesday, then on Thursday; if on Thursday, then on Tuesday; if on Friday, then on Wednesday. Thus give our and Russian typikons for the Feast of the Meeting on these days. Only, if the Feast falls on Monday, let the three-ode canon be sung on Tuesday, for when there is All-Night Vigil – Compline does not happen.
IV. THREE HIERARCHS
ON CHEESEFARE WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY
Their service is transferred from Wednesday to the previous Tuesday, and from Friday – to the previous Thursday .
________________________________________
 
FEBRUARY
Meeting of the Lord
Note
This feast falls on 2 February and therefore can fall either in the middle, or outside the Triodion. And since the first boundary of the Triodion is 11 January, and the last – 14 February, therefore it can fall at most 22 days from the beginning of the Triodion and 12 days before the beginning of the Triodion. When there is the earliest boundary of the Triodion, that is 11 January, then the feast reaches Monday of the first week of Lent, the next – immediately after the fourth Sunday of the Triodion, that is after Cheesefare Sunday. And if it falls outside the Triodion, then its order is celebrated according to the general rule of a feast of the Theotokos, although partly it is of the Lord. It differs from a feast of the Theotokos only by a separate dismissal and at the Liturgy – by a separate entrance verse, and on the Apodosis there will not be the Apostle-Gospel of the Feast and of the day, as for the Theotokos, but only of the day, as for the Lord. And if it falls on a Sunday, its service is combined with the Resurrectional, according to the rule of a feast of the Theotokos. It has one day of Forefeast and seven days of Afterfeast, for it is given up on 9 February.
If it falls in the middle of the Triodion and coincides in this way with the services of the Triodion, then it has a separate rule for the Forefeast, for the Feast and for the Afterfeast, as we present.
1 FEBRUARY Forefeast of the Meeting of the Lord

________________________________________
[367] Similarly also in the new Constantinopolitan Typikon the Forefeast is transferred back, to Friday; and in the new Greek-Venetian Menaion the service for the deceased is transferred to the Saturday of the Prodigal [Son].
[368] Similarly the Pochaiv Menaion, Moscow Typikon 1 February and Oko Tserkovne (in chapter 35 of Mark); but we do not know from where at the Praises, at "Glory, Both now" to take the stichera of the Forefeast, for it is not good that this one, which is at the Aposticha of Matins, be repeated at the Praises; better let that be repeated, which is at the Aposticha of Vespers.
[369] Rules of menaia ours and Russian; however, the Typikon of the Lviv University prescribes to the saint only two troparia.
[370] According to Oko Tserkovne "Blessed is the man" is sung; our handwritten typikon allows to sing either "Blessed is the man", or the sequential kathisma; the Greek Triodion prescribes the sequential kathisma, similarly also the Typikon of the Lviv University.
[371] Rules of menaia ours and Russian give an entrance, however, this does not correspond to the rule of the Triodion of Cheesefare Saturday, in which an entrance is not given, nor is it prescribed to sing "Blessed is the man". Rather one could assume an entrance if "Blessed is the man" is taken; however, even "Blessed is the man" by no means corresponds to a saint who does not have Polyeleos.

APODOSIS OF THE FEAST OF THE MEETING
Note
This Apodosis can fall either in the middle, or outside the Triodion. In the middle of the Triodion, if the Triodion falls on one of 30 days from 11 January to 9 February inclusive; outside the Triodion, if it falls on other five days, from 10 to 14 February. And if it falls outside the Triodion, then the Apodosis will be 9 February, according to the general rule of the Apodosis of a feast of the Theotokos; And in this case the Afterfeast has 7 days inclusive with the Apodosis. But if it falls in the middle of the Triodion, then the number of days of the Afterfeast from 7 can be reduced to 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, and the reason for this – various services of the Triodion, with which it coincides. However, this reduction does not always take place in the middle of the Triodion, but only when the Apodosis of the Feast coincides with certain services of the Triodion, which are incompatible with the service of the Feast. Such are: Meatfare Saturday (of Souls), Meatfare Sunday, which is of the Last Judgment, Cheesefare Wednesday and Friday, which have a completely Lenten rule, and Monday of the 1st week of Lent, on which the day of 9 February can fall, and partially also Cheesefare Sunday. Generally one can establish such a rule: if Pascha falls on days from 8 April and earlier, and the Triodion – from 28 January and earlier, then the Apodosis of the Meeting will be 9 February, that is on the seventh day after the Feast. When in a given year the Apodosis of the Feast will be at its proper time, and earlier, when there will be no Apodosis at all, the following table, compiled according to the rules of Slavic menaia, will show.
SCHEME OF THE APODOSIS OF THE MEETING

In the 2nd case it is given up already on Cheesefare Tuesday, since Wednesday, which is after it, has a completely Lenten rule.
In the 3rd case it is given up already on Cheesefare Thursday, since the following Friday has a completely Lenten rule.
In the 4th case it is given up on Cheesefare Saturday, since Cheesefare Sunday is incompatible with the service of the Feast.
In the 5th case it is given up on Cheesefare Sunday, since the following Monday – is already of Great Lent.
In the 6th case there will be no Apodosis, for the following Monday – is already of Great Lent, but the service of the feast ends with the feast itself. Similarly in the 7th case there will be no Apodosis, but the feast is transferred to Cheesefare Sunday and ends with it.
The Menaion gives three following cases, when the service of the Apodosis of the Feast is celebrated with the Triodion:

24 FEBRUARY First and Second Finding of the Precious Head of the Forerunner
Notes
1.	Since the last boundary of the Triodion is 14 February, this feast always falls in the middle of the Triodion. If the Triodion is earlier, then this feast enters all the deeper into the Triodion and coincides with many Triodion services. Even more, this feast can coincide with other services, given in the Triodion from Wednesday of Meatfare Week to Tuesday of the 8th week of the Triodion, that is of the 4th of Great Lent, inclusive. The last boundary of the beginning of the Triodion is 14 February, and after subtracting from 14 February 13 days, which precede the beginning of the Triodion, 11 will remain, dividing which by 7, we will get in the quotient 1, with 4 in the remainder, that is one whole week and one not whole – the first four days; and since the first day of the first week is Sunday (for the Triodion begins on Sunday), then the first day of the second week will be Sunday, the second – Monday, the third – Tuesday, the fourth – Wednesday. And since the first Sunday of the Triodion is the Sunday of the Publican, the second – of the Prodigal [Son], the third – Meatfare, then the Wednesday on which the Finding falls will be Meatfare Wednesday (for in the Lenten Triodion the days of the week are named after the following Sunday), as the earliest boundary of this feast in relation to the Triodion. And that the last boundary of this feast in relation to the Triodion is Tuesday of the 4th week of Great Lent is proven thus. The first boundary of the Triodion is 11 January, from which to 24 February will be 45 days, dividing which by 7, we will get 6 whole weeks with a remainder of 3; but, since the first day of this remainder is Sunday, as is the first day of each of the 6 past weeks, it will be the 7th Sunday of the Triodion, and the second day will be Monday, the third – Tuesday of the 8th week of the Triodion, of the 4th of Great Lent.
2.	The Service of this feast – of the type of a Saint with Polyeleos without All-Night Vigil, and since it coincides with services of the Triodion, it has 12 following cases.

It is celebrated according to the rules of St. George, here on p. 280, with the exception of the All-Night Vigil, as noted about St. Mark, 25 April. Although St. George does not reach the Sunday of the Blind Man like James, however, the Sunday of the Blind Man has the same rule as the three preceding Sundays, to which St. James reaches. But since on Wednesday after the Sunday of the Blind Man – is the Apodosis of the Resurrection, and on Thursday – Ascension, to which the rules of St. George do not reach, in these two cases one should adhere to the rule of the Theologian on 8 May, which we will give below, with the exception of the All-Night Vigil, which James does not have.

7 MAY Appearance of the Sign of the Precious Cross in the sky in Jerusalem
and of the Holy Martyr Acacius
The Service of this day – of small type, without Polyeleos, without Great Doxology and incomplete, for it has only a Troparion and Kontakion, stichera at "Lord, I have cried", a canon at Matins, at the Liturgy – Apostle-Gospel and Communion Hymn to the Cross from 14 September, as our and Russian typikons and the Venetian Menaion give, according to others – only Troparion and Kontakion. It coincides with services of the Flowery Triodion from Friday before the Sunday of the Myrrh-bearers to Thursday before the Descent of the Holy Spirit.
The Menaion gives only one rule – for weekdays in the middle of the feast. If, however, this service falls on one of the Sundays of Pentecost, or on some other day, on which the service of a Saint without Polyeleos should be sung at Compline or should be transferred to another day, we think that it too should be subject to this rule. The Service of St. Acacius is sung at Compline.

These two feasts, and also the Beheading of the Precious Head of the Forerunner, have the general rule of a Saint with All-Night Vigil, however, they exceed the Saint with All-Night Vigil in the following points:
1.	At Matins, before their canon, the Canon to the Theotokos is not taken, but only their two canons on 14, irmos of the first canon – twice, then troparia of both canons on 12, that is of one on 6 and of the other on 6.
2.	At the Liturgy the Apostle-Gospel is read only of the Saint, and of the day is read on the previous day just as on Feasts of the Lord and of the Theotokos.
3.	Their service is not celebrated in one day, but in two; however, on the second day their service – is of the daily type and combined with the service of the Octoechos and of the sequential saint so, that the Octoechos takes the first place, the Forerunner or the Chiefs [of the Apostles] – the second, according to the rule of a Saint on 4, and the sequential saint – the third. It is also proper to take their Troparion and Kontakion of the day at the Hours and at the Liturgy.
RULE FOR 24 AND 29 JUNE
if they fall with the Feast of the Eucharist
and with the Co-suffering of the Most Holy Theotokos 
In relation to the Feast of the Eucharist these saints have three cases:
1.	In the middle of the Feast of the Eucharist.
2.	On Sunday, to which the Feast of the Eucharist is transferred.
3.	On the Apodosis of the Feast of the Eucharist.
In the first case, that is in the middle of the feast, they are subject to the general rule of a Saint with All-Night Vigil in the middle of a feast, likewise also on Thursday of the Feast, for the Service of the Feast with All-Night Vigil is transferred to Sunday.
In the second case, that is on the Sunday of the Eucharist, by the decision of the Lviv Synod, the Sunday service is not taken and in our opinion (since there is no rule) one should sing the service of the Feast with the service of the Forerunner or of the Chiefs, according to the rule of the Theologian on 8 May, if it falls on the Ascension, here on p. 295-296.
In the third case, that is on the Apodosis of the Eucharist, subject to the rule of the Finding of the Head of the Forerunner on 25 May, when it falls on the Apodosis of the Ascension, here on p. 300-301. However, since in this case there will be All-Night Vigil, which the Finding does not have, here, at Small Vespers, after the stichera at "Lord, I have cried" and at the Aposticha is sung Both now: stichera of the Feast, and after the Troparion of the Saints – Glory, and now: Troparion of the Feast; likewise also at the Litya – stichera of the saints with Both now: of the Feast; at the blessing of loaves: Troparion of the Saints twice and "Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos" once .
In relation to the Feast of the Co-suffering, with which these saints can coincide (for the rule has nothing), they are subject to the rule of the Theologian on 8 May, when he falls on the Feast of the Ascension, here on p. 295-296. However, since the Co-suffering does not have All-Night Vigil, at Small Vespers everything is sung only to the Saint, and at Great Matins all sessional hymns will be to the Saint, Glory, and now: of the Feast. Everything else up to the canon – only to the Saints. Canon of the Feast with irmos on 6 and to the Saints on 8. If 25 and 30 June, that is the second day of the Feast of these Saints, falls with the Co-suffering of the Most Holy Theotokos, then their service is taken at Compline. 
JULY
2 JULY Deposition of the Precious Robe of the Most Holy Theotokos
Polyeleos – at choice .
1. On weekdays
If this service is not sung with Polyeleos, then it has the appearance of a daily [service] with stichera at "The Praises" and with the Great Doxology, however, on weekdays it displaces the service of the Octoechos. If it be with Polyeleos, then Vespers and Matins – of Great type.
2. On Sunday
For the case of Sunday church books do not give a rule. We think that at Vespers, if there be no Polyeleos, at "Lord, I have cried" there should be 6 Resurrectional stichera and 4 of the Theotokos . If there be Polyeleos, then 4 Resurrectional and 6 of the Theotokos, Glory: of the Theotokos, Both now: Dogmatikon of the tone. At the Aposticha – Glory, and now: of the Robe. Troparia at the end of Vespers and at "God is the Lord" we end with the Troparion of the Robe, and at the Liturgy – with the Kontakion of the Robe.
At Compline, after "It is truly meet" – Kontakion of the Robe.
At Great Matins, if there be Polyeleos, from the Gradual to the canon everything only Resurrectional is sung, as usual. Everything else at Matins, at the Hours and at the Liturgy is sung according to the general rule of a feast of the Theotokos on Sunday. If there be no Polyeleos, then Sessional hymns of the Robe, of the Polyeleos and "Great Doxology" we do not sing. Everything else we sing according to the general rule of a feast of the Theotokos.
RULE OF THE DEPOSITION OF THE PRECIOUS ROBE
ON THE CO-SUFFERING OF THE MOST HOLY THEOTOKOS 
In church books there is no rule for this case. However, we think that then the Service of the Deposition should be transferred to the following Saturday, and the Service of the sequential saint of Saturday sung at Compline.
16 JULY Holy Fathers of the first six ecumenical councils
Everything according to the rule of the Holy Fathers of the Seventh Ecumenical Council 11 October, here on p. 130-131.
20 JULY Holy Prophet Elias
The Service of the Prophet, by the decree of the Lviv Synod, must be celebrated with All-Night Vigil and from a weekday be transferred to Sunday.
Everything – according to the general rule of a Saint with All-Night Vigil on Sunday .
Note: If the Sunday, to which the Service of the Prophet is transferred falls on 25 July, when there will be Polyeleos, it should be transferred to the previous Sunday.
25 JULY Dormition of St. Anne, mother of the Most Holy Theotokos,
and memory of the holy women Olympias and Eupraxia
Note
Although even in ancient typikons the Service of St. Anne is given of small type with the service of the Octoechos and of the holy women , however, with time it was honored with us with Polyeleos, and by the decision and decree of the Synod of Zamość, even with All-Night Vigil  (although with us there is none, but only Polyeleos); and with the Greeks – Great Vespers with stichera at the Litya, and also Great Matins, from the canon and further .
"The canon of the holy women we take at Compline, when the superior decides" .
RULE
Everything – according to the general rule of a Saint with Polyeleos, whether on Sunday, or on weekdays. However, stichera and troparia we do not end with Theotokia of the Octoechos, but of the Saint, as if Theotokia, only on Sunday at "Lord, I have cried" we end with the Dogmatikon of the tone, and the Praises – with the Theotokion "Most blessed art Thou".

and of the holy and righteous Eudocimus
Notes
1.	The Feast of the Procession of the Precious Wood on 1 August has a Forefeast, which is – today, that is 31 July, but it has no Afterfeast.
2.	Although it has a Forefeast, however, of small type, that is without Polyeleos, and the service of the Cross does not exclude the service of the sequential saint, nor of the Octoechos, neither in the Forefeast, nor on the Feast, nor on Sunday, nor on a weekday.
3.	In the Forefeast and on the Feast the first place is occupied by the service of the Octoechos, the second – of the Cross, the third – of the Saint.
4.	The service of the Forefeast has the composition of a service of a Saint on 4 and the service of St. Eudocimus also has the appearance of a Saint on 4, since these two services are combined with the service of the Octoechos both on weekdays, and on Sunday, then the order on weekdays will be according to the general rule of two saints, falling with the Octoechos on weekdays, only the stichera at "Lord, I have cried" and at the Aposticha we end with the stichera of the Forefeast, except Friday evening, when the stichera at "Lord, I have cried" we end with the 1st Theotokion of the tone. On Sunday the order will be according to the general rule of a Forefeast with one Saint without Polyeleos with Octoechos on Sunday. Likewise also troparia we do not end with the usual Theotokion, but with the Troparion of the Forefeast, according to the general rule of a Forefeast. Therefore, there will be:

1 AUGUST Procession of the Wood of the Precious Cross
and memory of the Holy Martyrs Maccabees
Note
The Procession of the Precious Cross , which took place once in Constantinople from the imperial palace to the most beautiful church of Sophia, we depict now by the bringing out of the Precious Cross in the evening first from the sacristy to the Holy Table, and then, on the day of 1 August, from the Holy Table to the tetrapod, at Matins during the Doxology, when the Veneration also takes place, according to the rule of 14 September, on p. 120, except the Exaltation, which happens only on 14 September on the Exaltation of the Precious Cross, and here there will be none. Besides this, in Slavic books on this day also the Lesser Blessing of Water is prescribed either at Matins immediately before the Veneration, or later, at another time of the day. In some places also the blessing of herbs takes place, as on the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos .
RULE
1. On weekdays
Everything, as in the Forefeast 31.VII, here on p. 308-309, however:
1.	After the Dismissal of Vespers the Bringing Out of the Precious Cross from the sacristy to the Holy Table takes place, according to the rule of 14 September, here on p. 121-122.
2.	At Matins: Canon of the Octoechos on 4, of the Cross on 6 and of the Saints on 4. Katavasia after each ode – sequential "The Cross having been traced" (14 September). After the 3rd ode – Kontakion-Ikos and Sessional hymn of the Saints, only Both now: of the Cross; after the 6th – Kontakion-Ikos of the Cross; after the 9th – Exaposteilarion of the Octoechos, Glory: of the Saints, Both now: of the Cross.
3.	Stichera of the Praises – 6: 3 of the Cross and 3 of the Saints, Glory: of the Saints, Both now: of the Cross.
4.	During the singing of the Praises the priest, having vested in all sacred vestments (of violet color)  and having exclaimed before the steps of the Holy Table: "Glory to Thee, Who hast shown us the light", and having censed the precious Cross, carries it out around the Holy Table through the northern doors before the Holy Doors, and after the end of the Great Doxology with the Trisagion, exclaims: "Wisdom, attend", goes before the tetrapod and, having placed the precious Cross on it, when the choir sings the Troparion "Save, O Lord", censes it from four sides and venerates the precious Cross, everything exactly as on 14 September, here on p. 122-127.
5.	The Blessing of Water, if it be outside Matins, is celebrated whole just as you have in the Trebnik. If it be at Matins, then after the singing of the Doxology and the Troparion "Save, O Lord", that is immediately before the Veneration, in the rite of the Blessing of Water the beginning and the end is not taken, but immediately after the Troparion "Save, O Lord" begins "That rejoice" ("Yezhe raduisya") and ends with the stichera "O Most Holy Lady, receive", not taking the litany "Have mercy on us, O God" and the rest.
6.	The Blessing of Herbs, if there be any, usually takes place at the Liturgy after the Prayer behind the Ambo just as on the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos.
2. On Sunday
Everything – according to the general rule of the Afterfeast with a Saint without Polyeleos on Sunday, here on p. 93-96, only:
1.	On Saturday evening, after the Dismissal of Vespers the Bringing Out of the Precious Cross from the sacristy to the Holy Table takes place, and at Matins, during the Great Doxology, from the Holy Table to the tetrapod, according to the rule of 14 September. However, after the exclamation "Wisdom, attend", instead of the Troparion "Save, O Lord", we sing the Resurrectional Troparion, one of the two usual ones, at which the priest should cense the Precious Cross from four sides and immediately after this perform the veneration of the Precious Cross, singing the Troparion "Before Thy Cross we bow down", or before the veneration perform also the rite of the Blessing of Water, according to the rule given here for weekdays, no. 5.
2.	At the Liturgy: the entire service is taken first of the Sunday, and then – of the Cross. The Service of the Saints, since it is without Polyeleos, is not taken. If someone would prefer to take it too, then Prokeimena, Alleluia and Communion Hymns will be only two: to the Cross and to the Saints, and Apostle-Gospels – three: sequential, of the Cross and of the Saints . 
6 AUGUST Transfiguration of the Lord
Everything – according to the general rule of a Feast of the Lord, only after the Prayer behind the Ambo , as Slavic typikons give, or after the Dismissal of the Liturgy, as the Peremyshl Trebnik gives, the priest blesses on the tetrapod the first grapes (and since we have no grapes, then the first fruits) with one prayer, given in the Menaion, or with three, given in our Trebnik , with censing and sprinkling them with holy water at the end.
Note: If this blessing takes place after the Prayer behind the Ambo, then we think that it is not necessary to sing before that the Usual Beginning and everything else with "Our Father", Psalm 60, Troparion and Kontakion of the Feast , but immediately "Let us pray to the Lord" and the prayer, for the Menaion prescribes only the prayer.
