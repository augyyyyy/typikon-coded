From the Publisher
Ritual discipline was and remains an important factor in the liturgical unity of every Church sui iuris (of its own right), one of which is the Ukrainian Catholic Church (UCC).
The Rite of the UCC was formed over centuries from the ancient Kyivan rite and today constitutes a rite distinct from others of Byzantine origin, which is often defined by the term "Byzantine-Ukrainian."
Ritual unity is achieved through the observance of unified rubrical prescriptions. From ancient times, the Eastern Churches began to use collections of such prescriptions, that is, Typikons (from the Greek word typikon).
In a Typikon, the most diverse combinations of services that may arise during the liturgical year are systematized, and precise instructions are given on how, in one case or another, to conduct the divine service "according to the rule" (ustavno), that is, correctly and in an exemplary manner.
In Ukraine, from the times of St. Theodosius of the Caves (†1074), the Studite Typikon (named after the Constantinopolitan monastery of St. Theodore the Studite) was in use, and from the 15th century, it was replaced by the Jerusalem Typikon (of the Lavra of St. Savva the Sanctified). In later centuries, domestic Typikons appeared: the Pochaiv Typikon of 1766, the Peremyshl Typikon of J. Doskovsky (editions of 1852, 1870, 1903), and the Uzhhorod Typikon (1890, 1901). Anonymous handwritten Typikons were also used.
In 1899, the world saw the Typikon of Fr. Isydor Dolnytsky (1830–1924), spiritual director and professor of the Greek-Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv, author of many new services of the UCC. Compiled based on the materials of the Lviv Synod of 1891, which had immense significance in the history of our Church, Fr. Dolnytsky’s Typikon presents rich practical and historical liturgical material.
It is generally known that the UCC began to be reborn on its historical lands only in 1989, after nearly 40 years of existence in the catacombs. This does not mean that after the "Lviv Sobor" of 1946, liturgical life of the Catholic Church in Ukraine ceased, but the long absence of communication, of contacts with the outside world, and with other parts of the UCC, took its toll in many areas of Church life, particularly in ritual matters.
In recent years, the decline of ritual discipline has been felt especially keenly. It was felt most in the Roman educational institutions of the UCC, to which students from Ukrainian eparchies all over the world come for studies.
The long-time rector of one such institution, the Ukrainian Papal College of St. Josaphat, Fr. Dr. Sofron Mudry, OSBM, inspired by the danger of losing ritual identity, initiated the realization of a new edition of Fr. Dolnytsky’s Typikon, as the previous edition had long been out of print, yet the Typikon itself had not lost its practical significance. The language of the original, Church Slavonic, is already little understood today, so there was a palpable need for a translation of the Typikon into the modern Ukrainian language.
At the initiative of Fr. Dr. S. Mudry in 1979, the then spiritual director of the College of St. Josaphat, Fr. Rodion Holovatsky, OSBM, began purposeful work on the translation of the Typikon, which was interrupted by the sudden death of the spiritual father in July 1985. The translation, which was carried out with strict adherence to the original text, without any changes, was completed in its editing phase in 1992. Participating in the work on the translation were Fr. Dr. Parteniy Pavlyk (translation of Greek texts), Fr. Dorotey Shymchiy (notes), and Fr. Josaphat Romanyk (Part 2).
The final editing of the translation was reviewed by a commission composed of: Fr. Dr. Severian Yakymyshyn, consultor of the Liturgical Commission at the Congregation for the Eastern Churches; Fr. Dr. Porfiriy Pidruchny; and Fr. Mgr. Mykhailo Havryliv. By the decision of the commission, the "Rule of Divine Services" (Ustav bohosluzhen’), approved by the Apostolic See in 1944 and first published in the Ukrainian language in 1958, which replaced the first part of the Typikon, i.e., "General View of Divine Services," is added to the translation of the Typikon. However, this first part does not lose its significance as a valuable historical source of the development of the rite. We also note in which points the Typikon of Fr. Dolnytsky has lost its relevance today:
1.	Liturgical prescriptions of Part 1 of Fr. Dolnytsky's Typikon, taken from the "Appendix" of the Lviv Synod published in 1896, are valid today only insofar as they agree with the Roman "Order of Divine Services" (Ordo Celebrationis), or explain or supplement it in some way.
2.	Rubrics concerning various fasts, given by Fr. Dolnytsky's Typikon, are no longer valid today, because in 1966 the Episcopate of the UCC, under the leadership of Major Archbishop and Cardinal Josyf Slipyj, issued new norms in which they obliged all clergy, monastics, and faithful in conscience to observe the fast, namely:
a) On all Fridays of the entire year, with the exception of compact weeks (zahalnytsia) and occurring Feasts of the Lord and the Theotokos – abstinence from meat;
b) On the first day of the Great Fast and on Good Friday – abstinence from meat and dairy foods;
c) On the Eve of the Nativity and Theophany, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Precious Cross, and the Beheading of the Precious Head of St. John the Baptist – abstinence from meat with a single meal to satiety with additional modest snacks, according to local customs;
His Beatitude the Major Archbishop permitted bishops, pastors, and confessors to grant other alleviations in case of need, according to the spirit of the rite (Herald of the Major Archbishop, 1966, vol. 2, art. 195).
3.	The Holy Liturgy is permitted to be abbreviated as presented in the Liturgicon (Sluzhebnyk) issued by the Synod of Bishops of the UCC in 1989, and the Apostle and Gospel are permitted to be taken as one [per reading], even if two fall on that day (Herald of the Major Archbishop, 1965, vol. 1, p. 42). With the blessing of the rector (pastor), for the purpose of shortening the divine services, it is permitted to omit secondary Troparia and Kontakia if several fall on a certain day; with the same blessing, it is permitted not to take the same Troparion, Sessional Hymn, or the same Stichera twice or thrice.
The need for rubrical literature is constantly growing. The reason for this is the rebirth of the UCC on its historical lands; therefore, the editors believe and hope that the new edition of Fr. Dolnytsky's Typikon, now in the Ukrainian language, will serve for the best possible education of the new generation of clergy of our Church.
Like every work of such magnitude, this translation is not devoid of errors and flaws. The editors are grateful in advance to all those who send their remarks.
