(twice)

With what wreaths of hymns shall we crown this holy bishop?* He is the invincible support of devotion and the avowed enemy of godlessness,* the zealous defender of the faith and the teacher and master of holy monks,* the harmonious lyre of the Spirit and the golden tongue,* the fountain from which the faithful draw healing waters,* Gregory, who is worthy of all admiration.

With what lips shall we mortals praise this holy bishop?* He is the teacher of the Church and the herald of the divine light,* the one who is immersed in the Trinity,* the most beautiful adornment of holy monks,* renowned for his divine contemplation and the brightness of his virtues;* the pride and the glory of Thessalonica;* and the holy Demetrius, whose relics flow with holy oil,* shares with him the kingdom of heaven.

(Tone 6): Glory be: O most holy and thrice-blessed Father,* you are a disciple of Christ the high-priest as well as the good shepherd;* you have given your life for your sheep.* And now, O holy and God-bearing Gregory,* intercede with Him to grant us his great mercy.

Now and for ever: Dogmatikon of the tone of the week.

Aposticha

Stichera from the resurrectional tone of the the week, then:

Glory be: (Tone 8): Your voice, which is always ready to teach* resounds in the ears of our hearts;* it awakens even the sloathful souls.* And by your inspired words,* you show us the steps of the ladder which leads us from earth to God.* O holy Gregory, wonder of Thessalonica,* intercede with Christ, that with his divine brightness,* He may enlighten those who honor your memory.

Now and for ever: O virgin, You have never known wedlock,* yet you conceived God in the flesh* in a manner which words can never describe.* You thus became the Mother of God on high.* O Immaculate Lady, receive the supplication of your servants* and grant us the cleansing of our sins.* Accept now our prayers and beseech God to save all of us.

Canticle of Simeon; Holy God; Trinity most holy; Our Father; resurrectional troparion. Glory be: Troparion of St. Gregory, (see below). Now and for ever: O gracious Lord, p. 1272.)

SUNDAY MATINS

Resurrectional Troparion as at yesterday's Vespers, then Troparion of St. Gregory:

(Troparion of St. Gregory, Tone 8): O light of the true faith, teacher and support of the Church,* adornment of monks and invincible rampart of theologians.* O holy Gregory the Wonder-worker,* the glory of Thessalonica and the herald of grace* intercede with God for the salvation of our souls.

Glory be: Now and for ever: O gracious Lord, for the sake of all You were born of a virgin;* through your death on the cross You conquered death;* and through your resurrection you revealed yourself as God.* O merciful Lord, do not disdain those who You have created with your hands,* but show forth your love for us.* Accept the intercession which the Mother, who bore You, makes in our behalf.* O Savior, save your desparing people!

After Psalm 50

(Tone 8): Glory be: Open to me the doors of repentance, O Giver of life.* As we worship in your temple this morning,* teach us how to purify the temples of our bodies,* and in your compassion, purify me by the goodness of your mercies.

Lead me to the paths of salvation, O Mother of God, for I have condemned myself with shameful sins and have wasted all my life in slothfulness. By your intercession purify me from all sinfulness.

(Tone 6): Have mercy on me, God, in your kindness. In your compassion blot out my offense.

When I think upon the multitude of my evil deeds, I tremble for the terrible Day of Judgment. But trusting in the compassion of your mercy, O Lord, I cry to your like David: Have mercy upon me, O God according to your great mercy.

(Kontakion of St. Gregory, Tone 8): We praise you, O holy bishop Gregory,* as a divine instrument of wisdom* and as the brilliant trumpet of the knowledge of God.* We submit you minds to the intelligence of the Creator;* lead our hearts to Him that we may sing:* Rejoice O preacher of grace.

Canon (Resurrectional and the following):

Ode 9

Hirmos: May every child of the earth exult in spirit and hold aloft the burning lamp; may the angels in heaven praise with joy the holy feast of the Mother of God and sing to her: Rejoice, O blessed and ever-virgin, holy Mother of God.

Verse: Glory be to You, our God, glory be to You!

You have become a mirror of God and in you the divine image is perfectly reflected; you have nobly set the spirit as master over the passions of the flesh; you have attained your likeness to God and became a brilliant dwelling of the Holy Trinity.

Verse: Glory be to You, our God, glory be to You!

The pious Emperor has made you a winged messenger who walks on the clouds; and filled with the Spirit, you overcome the foolish pride of Barlaam who spoke falsely about God; but you have rightly been victorious over him.

You were completely filled with wisdom, and you made your brightness shine throughout the world; you were a fountain flowering with the doctrine of the true faith; and in your love for a better teaching, you conceived the fear of God in your heart, and you brought forth the words of the Spirit.

Glory be: Now and for ever: With one voice, we the faithful, sing our hymn of thanksgiving to you; O Mother of God, you have destroyed the ancient curse, and because of you, we now reap the blessing, light and salvation, mercy and unending joy.

May every child of the earth exult in spirit and hold aloft the burning lamp; may the angels in heaven praise with joy the holy feast of the Mother of God and sing to her: Rejoice, O blessed and ever virgin, holy Mother of God.

Exapostilarion and the following:

Rejoice, pride of our holy fathers;* rejoice, voice of inspired theologians,* tabernacle of inward stillness,* dwelling-place of knowledge and throne of doctrine,* spiritual ocean where action and contemplation blend,* healer of human illnesses.* You are the temple of the Spirit,* O Father who are dead and yet still alive.

Glory be: Now and for ever: O Virgin Queen of the universe,* come to our aid in peril and affliction;* help us in times of distress;* rescue us from the devil, from Hades and perdition;* make us worthy to stand fearlessly before the awesome judgment seat of your Son,* through your prayers, O Mother of God.

Stichera at the Praises

Stichera from the resurrectional tone of the week and the following:

(Tone 1): Blessed is the life you led in this world* and which you now enjoy in the assembly of the blessed;* with the meek, you have inherited the earth;* you are rich in the sight of God, O bishop Gregory,* and you pour out your treasure of grace* upon those who venerate your name.

Verse: The mouth of the just utters wisdom, and their lips speak what is right.

You have made the doctrines of the true faith grow* by cutting off the thorns of those who teach error;* you have multiplied the seed of faith in good soil,* watering it with the rain of your teaching;* and, as a good steward, you offered the hundredfold to God.

Verse: Your priests shall be clothed with holiness; your faithful shall ring out their joy.

The loftiness of your sinless life* amazed both angels and people;* for you showed yourseelf to be an ascetic and a fighter,* a sincere friend and a bishop,* and a worthy minister of the divine mysteries.

Glory be: (Tone 6): In this season of abstinence,* You have risen as light, O Christ,* upon those who walk in the darkness of sin.* Let us see the glorious day of your Passion,* so that we may sing to You:* Arise, O God, and have mercy on us.

Now and for ever: You are truly most blessed O virgin Mother of God.* Through the One who was incarnate of you.* Hades was chained, Adam revived, the curse wiped out,* Eve set free, Death put to death,* and we ourselves were brught back to life.* That is why we cry out in praise:* Blessed are You, O Christ our God,* who finds in this your good pleasure. Glory to You!
