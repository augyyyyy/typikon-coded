JANUARY 1
CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND ST. BASIL THE GREAT
VESPERS

Blessed is the man....

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 8): In His love for the human race,* the Savior condescended and willed to be wrapped in swaddling clothes.* Eight days old according to His mother* and eternal according to His Father,* He did not look down upon the circumcision of the flesh.* Therefore, O believers, let us cry out to Him:* You are our God; have mercy on us!

(Tone 4, Podoben – Zvanyj svyshe byv): Your name, father Basil, is royal, and your priesthood royal,* for you led the holy Christian people by your piety and knowledge.* Then the Lord of all and King of kings* adorned you with the crown of the kingdom, O Basil.* He is the everlasting and co-eternal Son* Who was united to her that bore Him.* Therefore, intercede with Him* that He may enlighten and save our souls.

Adorned with the vestments of a bishop, O Basil,* you gladly proclaimed the Gospel of the kingdom* and poured out the teachings of the true faith for the Church.* Now enlightened by them, we confess and glorify* the one Godhead, indivisible in three Persons;* namely the almighty Father, the only-begotten Word of God, and the Divine Spirit.* Intercede with Him that He may enlighten and save our souls.

You are now living among the ranks of the heavenly powers, O Basil;* for you imitated their life with the purity of your way of living.* When you were in the flesh,* you lived on earth as one without flesh.* Therefore, intercede with Christ our God for us* who delight in your God-inspired teachings,* that He may protect us from dangers and the darkness of ignorance,* and that He may enlighten our souls.

(Tone 3): The holy chrism of grace was poured out upon you, O God-inspired Basil;* and anointed you as minister of the Gospel of the kingdom of heaven.* You were the sweet fragrance of Christ;* you filled the earth with the fragrance of His knowledge.* Graciously hear the voices of your servants* and ask abundant mercy for us who honor you.

Clothed in priestly vestments, holy Basil,* O defender of the Trinity, you stood before the tribunal,* braving danger for the faith.* You resisted with the undaunted courage of a martyr.* You put to shame the anger of the bold emperor* who was filled with the power of the ungodly.* You willingly decided beforehand to accept the sufferings that he threatened.* Having been ready of your own choice to be a martyr,* you received the crown of victory from Christ* Who has shown you great mercy.

Glory be: (Tone 8): O venerable Father, you became a lover of wisdom,* preferring life with God to all possessions of the world.* Your contemplation of death made you forsake the wealth of the earth,* and by your perseverance in fastings,* you overcame the sting of passions.* By study of the divine law* you preserved the freedom within your soul.* By your generous practice of virtue* you subjected the passions of the flesh to the spirit.* You renounced the flesh, the world, and the princes of the earth;* now you stand in the presence of Christ.* Intercede with Him for great mercy upon our souls.

Now and for ever: The all-good God was not ashamed to be circumcised in the flesh,* but He offered Himself as a symbol and an example of salvation to all.* For the Maker of the Law submitted Himself to its commands* and to what the prophets beforehand told of Him.* O our God Who holds all things in Your hands* and yet were wrapped in swaddling clothes,* O Lord, glory to You!

The entrance; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day; and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of Proverbs.

The mouth of the just yields wisdom, / but the perverse tongue will be cut off. / The lips of the just know how to please, / but the mouth of the wicked, how to pervert. / False scales are an abomination to the LORD, / but a full weight is his delight. / When pride comes, disgrace comes; / but with the humble is wisdom. / The honesty of the upright guides them; / the faithless are ruined by their duplicity. / Wealth is useless on the day of wrath, / but virtue saves from death. / The honest man’s virtue makes his way straight, / but by his wickedness the wicked man falls. / The virtue of the upright saves them, / but the faithless are caught in their own intrigue. / When a wicked man dies his hope perishes, / and what is expected from strength comes to nought. / The just man escapes trouble, / and the wicked man falls into it in his stead. / With his mouth the impious man would ruin his neighbor, / but through their knowledge the just make their escape. / When the just prosper, the city rejoices; / and when the wicked perish, there is jubilation. / Through the blessing of the righteous the city is exalted, / but through the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown. / He who reviles his neighbor has no sense, / but the intelligent man keeps silent (10:31-11:12).

Other readings: Genesis (17:1-14); Proverbs (8:22-30).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 3): With your life of purity, O holy Basil,* you attracted Christ, the fountain of life, to dwell in your soul.* You channeled streams of inspired teachings to the world.* The faithful people of the Church drink from them* and acknowledge the teachings of your lips* and offer good works to Him* Who glorified your memory for all ages.

(Tone 6): The grace flowed from your lips, O holy Father Basil.* You were the shepherd of the Church of Christ,* teaching your spiritual sheep to believe in the holy Trinity,* consubstantial in the one Godhead.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): In His love for the human race,* the Savior condescended and willed to be wrapped in swaddling clothes.* Eight days old according to His mother* and eternal according to His Father,* He did not look down upon the circumcision of the flesh.* Therefore, O believers, let us cry out to Him:* You are our God; have mercy on us!

Aposticha

(Tone 1): You were like a divine and noble bee of the Church of Christ, all-blessed Basil.* When you armed yourself with the sting of divine love,* you wounded the blasphemers of God-transgressing heresies,* and you stored up the sweetness of true worship in the souls of believers.* Now that you have attained the delights of the divine presence,* remember us before the consubstantial Trinity.

Verse: My lips will speak words of wisdom; my heart is full of insight.

You have acquired the virtues of all the saints, O Father Basil;* the meekness of Moses and the zeal of Elijah,* the confession of faith by Peter,* and the eloquence in theology of John.* Like Paul, you never cease to cry aloud:* Who is weak and I am not weak?* Who is offended and I burn not?* Therefore, because you dwell with them,* pray for the salvation of our souls.

Verse: The mouth of the just utters wisdom, and his lips speak what is right.

(Tone 2): O Basil, the revealer of holiness,* having studied the nature of creatures* and contemplated the instability of all things,* you found the only One Who is unchangeable,* the transcendent Creator of all the world.* And having clung to Him, you cast off the desire of transient things.* Therefore, intercede for us* that we may also obtain the divine love.

Glory be: (Tone 6): O all-blessed Basil, you received the grace of miracles from heaven* and exposed the errors of the heathen by your doctrines.* You are the glory and support of bishops,* and an example of the teachings of all the Fathers.* Therefore, having received favor with Christ,* intercede with Him for the salvation of our souls.

Now and for ever: (Tone 8): The all-good God was not ashamed to be circumcised in the flesh,* but He offered Himself as a symbol* and an example of salvation to all.* For the Maker of the Law submitted Himself to its commands* and to what the prophets beforehand told of Him.* O our God Who holds all things in Your hands* and yet were wrapped in swaddling clothes,* O Lord, glory to You!

At the blessing of the bread: the troparion of St. Basil; then immediately, without Glory be: Now and for ever: the troparion of the Circumcision, (p. 1276).

MATINS

After God the Lord...: the troparion of St. Basil; Glory be: Now and for ever: the troparion of the Circumcision, (p. 1276).

Sessional Hymns

(Tone 5, Podoben – Sobeznachalne slovo): Let us all extol Basil as the holy adornment of the Church,* the rich treasury of teachings.* Through them he taught us to honor the holy Trinity,* united in essence and distinct in persons.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 1): The Creator of all and the Lord of the universe,* Who is with the Father and the Spirit on high,* is circumcised on earth as an eight day old infant.* Your works, O Lord, are truly divine and wonderful.* O Master, You were circumcised for our sake that the law might be fulfilled.

(Tone 8): Marvelously drawing on the secret wealth of ineffable wisdom,* you stored up the waters of the true faith for all.* You made the hearts of the faithful rejoice,* and you destroyed the teachings of the unbelievers as deserved.* Because of your noble efforts you became the invincible champion of the holy Trinity.* O archbishop Basil, intercede with Christ our God to grant remission of sins* to those who celebrate your holy memory.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 4): The One Who is invisible in substance today appears in the flesh.* Today the uncreated Word is born from a chaste Virgin* for the salvation of the human race.* As a child of eight days He is circumcised according to the Law.* Therefore, let us worship Him as our Savior.

After the Polyeleos the Exaltation is sung:

We extol you,* O Basil, archbishop of Christ,* and we honor your holy memory* because you pray for us to Christ our God.

Verse: The mouth of the just utters wisdom; and his lips speak what is right.
Verse: Your priests shall be clothed with holiness; your faithful shall ring out their joy.

Sessional Hymn (Tone 8): The grace of your God-inspired words* and the mystical depths of your teachings were a ladder of divine ascent for us.* O Father, having become the trumpet of the Spirit,* you proclaimed the divine dogmas.* Therefore, you now dwell in the divine kingdom,* having received the reward of your efforts, O holy Bishop Basil.* Intercede with Christ our God to grant forgiveness of sins* to those who lovingly celebrate your holy memory.

Canon (Tone 2): Come, let us the faithful..., (p. 756).

Ode 9: Omit the Magnificat. Immediately after the intonation: Let us greatly extol the Theotokos..., the choir sings the ninth Hirmos with its verse:

Verse: O my soul, extol our father among the hierarchs Basil the Great.

Hirmos: The Divine Star had risen before daybreak and came to dwell among us. Ineffably conceived in the flesh, God came to us from your virginal womb, O pure and blessed One. Therefore, we extol you, O Mother of God.

Verse: Holy father and hierarch Basil, pray to God for us!

O holy father Basil, as a faithful sheep of Christ, you followed in the life-giving footsteps of the Shepherd. You courageously delivered your life into the hands of the tyrant, O blessed Father, exposing yourself to danger for the sake of the Church.

Verse: Holy father and hierarch Basil, pray to God for us!

O holy father Basil, you became worthy of the chair of the apostles, the ranks of the martyrs of Christ, the tabernacles of the patriarchs, the delight of the holy ones, and the company of the prophets. You were a friend of the Mother of God and a servant of the holy Trinity.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Come, let us extol the holy name of Christ - Jesus, which today is being bestowed upon Him in the temple; and let us also honor the memory of holy Basil.

Verse: Extol, my soul, the Virgin, the most pure Mother of God, who is more honorable and beyond compare more glorious than the heavenly hosts.

Katabasia: Hirmos (Tone 2): No tongue is capable of praising you worthily,* and no mind, however superhuman, is able to extol you, O Mother of God.* Good as you are, accept our faith,* for you know our love of God.* You are the guide of Christians, and we glorify you.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 5, Podoben – Radujsia): O Basil, by your rebirth in divine baptism,* you became a son of God.* You professed the eternal Son and Word of God* to be consubstantial and coeternal with the Father.* With the wisdom of your words,* you sealed the mouths of the heretics.* Therefore, you entered the heavenly kingdom,* truly reigning with Christ, the sole ruler by nature,* who bountifully gives His great mercy to the world.

Totally dedicated to God from your childhood,* you were enlightened with rays of divine knowledge.* You clarified the understanding of all creation,* clearly explaining and wisely making known its good order.* You laid the solid foundations of theology.* Therefore, we honor you as a prophetic and blessed teacher,* a light-bearing torch of the Church,* as we sing the praises of Christ* Who grants great mercy to the world.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): In His love for the human race,* the Savior condescended and willed to be wrapped in swaddling clothes.* Eight days old according to His mother* and eternal according to His Father,* He did not look down upon the circumcision of the flesh.* Therefore, O believers, let us cry out to Him:* You are our God; have mercy on us!

JANUARY 2-5
PREFEAST: THEOPHANY OF OUR LORD
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 4, Podoben – Jako dobl’a): Let us piously sing the prefestive hymns* of the honorable baptism of our God.* Behold, He desires to come in the flesh to His own forerunner,* and to ask for the baptism of salvation* for the re-creation of those who are enlightened through the faith* and who are partakers of the Spirit.

Christ is revealed and God appears, as it is written;* He comes to His servant to be baptized.* O river Jordan, O land and sea, O mountains and hills,* be filled with happiness; O hearts of the faithful,* joyfully celebrate and receive the great Light.

O all-powerful Lord,* how will the streams of the river receive You?* As it is written. You are the river and the stream of peace;* how will You enter the stream without a garment?* For You are the One Who covers the heavens with clouds;* You are the One Who stripped away all evil of the enemy* and Who clothed the human race with immortality.

Three stichera and Glory be: of the saint of the day.

Now and for ever: (Tone 6): Christ the Truth is coming to the Jordan* to be baptized by John,* and the Baptizer says to Him:* I should be baptized by You, but You are coming to me.* I do not dare to put straw to the fire.* O Master, sanctify me by Your divine Theophany.

On Friday and Saturday evenings: Dogmaticon of the tone of the week.

Aposticha

(Tone 1): Radiant was the feast that has just passed;* but more brilliant, O Savior, is the one approaching.* The first had an angel as a herald;* this one has John the Forerunner.* The first had blood spilled and had Bethlehem lament as one who was childless;* the second has blessed waters recognized to be a bath having many children.* Before, the star proclaimed to the Magi;* now, the Father shows You to the world,* that You are incarnate and are openly coming again.* O Lord, glory to You!

Verse: I think of You from the country of Jordan and Mount Hermon.

(Tone 2): Again Jesus cleanses Himself in the Jordan.* Above all, He cleanses our sins* because He is coming to wash away the decree written against Adam.* The Lord says to John:* O Baptizer, come and serve the Fountainhead of the wondrous mystery.* Come; extend your hand quickly* and touch the head of Him Who crushed the head of the serpent,* the One Who opened up paradise,* which, by the tasting of the fruit of the tree,* was closed through the guile of the serpent.

Verse: The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and trembled.

(Tone 3): Resplendent is the feast which has passed;* but more glorious is the present day.* On that day the Magi adored the Savior;* on this, the glorious servant baptizes the Master.* There, the shepherds sang in amazement;* here, the voice of the Father proclaims Him to be the only-begotten Son.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 3): Let all the earth rejoice today with the prophets* and let the mountains skip for joy!* Run back on your course, O Jordan,* as it is written, and fear the face of the Lord,* for God, having become man,* has come to cleanse every man of the sin of Adam.

Troparion of the saint; Glory be: Now and for ever: (from 2-4 of Jan.): Make ready... (p. 1277). On the fifth of January: the troparion: After Elijah..., (p. 1277).

MATINS

After God the Lord...: the Troparia as at Vespers (see above).

Sessional Hymns

(Tone 1): My Jesus, Lover of mankind!* Having clothed Yourself in my poverty,* You have become as a servant* and have asked to be baptized by a servant.* Seeing You, John exclaimed:* How can I baptize You, the all-good God,* Who are without stain?

Glory be: Now and for ever: In His goodness Christ comes to the streams of the Jordan,* and in them wishes by His grace to bring about our restoration.* Receive Him with joy, O Forerunner,* and wash in the waters Him Who desired this,* the only Lover of mankind.

(Tone 4, Podoben – Skoro Predvary): The all-rich One by becoming poor,* out of great mercy, desired to make us rich* who have become poor as a result of the ancient sin of intemperance.* He comes in order to enter the streams of the Jordan* to be manifestly baptized by John.* Let us faithful praise His great humility.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Today the words of Isaiah are fulfilled:* Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths!* For the desert-loving trumpet has sounded,* calling everyone, as the great John prophesied.* Therefore, let us gather together,* and we shall see great things.

Canon – Ode 9

Hirmos (Tone 2): Let us faithful with one mind extol with hymns the Word of God, Who, in His ineffable wisdom, came from God to renew Adam who, through eating, had grievously fallen into corruption. In an unspeakable manner, He became incarnate of the holy Virgin for our sakes.

Verse: Glory to You, our God, glory to You!

John, seeing You, the Benefactor, coming and humbly asking to be baptized by him, was astonished, for terrified he dared not touch with his hand Him Who touches the mountains and makes them smoke.

Verse: Glory to You, our God, glory to You!

Like a wonderful swallow announcing a spiritual springtime, the Baptizer appeared to those who were in the winter of numerous sins and were constantly experiencing the storms of evil passions and evil spirits.

Glory be: Now and for ever: O Virgin Mother of God, who gave birth to our good God and Lord, pour forth your gifts upon a soul oppressed by sins.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 2): No tongue is capable of praising you worthily,* and no mind, however superhuman, is able to extol you, O Mother of God.* Good as you are, accept our faith,* for you know our love of God.* You are the guide of Christians, and we glorify you.

Exapostilarion: The voice of one crying out in the wilderness thundered;* therefore, rejoice, O mountains!* Sing, O human race!* For the eternal Word has taken upon Himself a human body,* and has come to be baptized by hands created by Him,* thus drowning the sins of the world in the Jordan.

Aposticha

(Tone 6, Samopodoben): O angelic choirs, hasten from Bethlehem to the waters of the Jordan;* and You, John, leave the desert and hasten also to the river.* Rejoice, O river, and prepare yourself,* and let all the earth be glad,* for Christ, the merciful One,* is coming to wash away the sin of Adam.

Verse: I think of You from the country of Jordan and Mount Hermon.

With pure lips and cleansed souls,* all you generations of earth leave Bethlehem* and come in spirit with Christ to the Jordan* and happily sing to Him, exclaiming with faith:* Blessed are You Who have come, O our God;* glory be to You!

Verse: The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and trembled.

Great and awesome is the mystery!* God took on the likeness of a human being, and, without even knowing sin,* today, as sinner, asks John to be baptized in the Jordan.* Blessed are You Who have come, O our God;* glory be to You!

Glory be: Now and for ever: Christ, the Flower of David from the Virgin,* has today come to the streams of the Jordan,* in order to wash away the sins of the forefather.* Be glad, Adam, and be happy, Eve!* Let heaven rejoice, and we, people, let us say:* Blessed are You, O our God – glory be to You!

JANUARY 5
THE GREAT (HOLY) HOURS

(dark-red vestments)

If the eve of the Theophany falls on a Saturday or on a Sunday, then the Great Hours are taken on Friday.

FIRST HOUR

Priest: Blessed be our God, now and for ever and ever.
Choir: Amen. Glory be to You, our God...; (the usual beginning to Come, let us adore..., p. 10-11).

Psalm 26

The Lord is my light and my help; whom shall I fear?* The Lord is the stronghold of my life; before whom shall I shrink?

When evil-doers draw near to devour my flesh,* it is they, my enemies and foes, who stumble and fall.

Though an army encamp against me, my heart would not fear;* though war break out against me, even then would I trust.

There is one thing I ask of the Lord, for this I long, to live in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life,* to savor the sweetness of the Lord, to behold His temple.

For there He keeps me safe in His tent in the day of evil;* He hides me in the shelter of His tent, on a rock He sets me safe.

And now my head shall be raised above my foes who surround me* and I shall offer within His tent a sacrifice of joy, I will sing and make music for the Lord.

O Lord, hear my voice when I call;* have mercy and answer.

Of You my heart has spoken: “Seek His face.”* It is Your face, O Lord, that I seek.

Hide not Your face from me, dismiss not Your servant in anger;* You have been my help, do not abandon or forsake me, O God my help!

Though father and mother forsake me,* the Lord will receive me.

Instruct me, Lord, in Your way, on an even path lead me;* when they lie in ambush protect me from my enemy’s greed.

False witnesses rise against me,* breathing out fury.

I am sure I shall see the Lord’s goodness* in the land of the living.

Hope in Him, hold firm and take heart.* Hope in the Lord!

Psalms 5, (p. 150), and Psalm 22 may be taken.

Glory be: Now and for ever:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to You, O God! (3x).
Lord, have mercy. (3x).

Glory be: (Tone 4): After Elijah had gone up..., (p. 1277).

Now and for ever: What shall we call you, O Full of Grace? A heaven, for you have borne the Sun of justice? A paradise, for you have brought forth the Flower of immortality? A virgin, for you have remained undefiled? A mother, holding in her holy arms the Son Who is the God of all? Intercede with Him for the salvation of our souls.

Then we sing the following stichera:

(Tone 8, Samohlasen): As man You came to the river Jordan, O Christ King,* and You hasten, O Gracious One,* to receive the baptism of a servant* from the hands of the Forerunner for our sins,* O Lover of mankind.

Glory be: Now and for ever: To the voice of the one crying in the wilderness:* Prepare the way of the Lord;* You came, O Lord, as a servant seeking to be baptized* even though You had no sin.* When the waters saw You, they trembled in fear* like the Forerunner who exclaimed:* How can a lamp give light to the Light?* How can a servant touch his Master?* Rather, O Savior, bless the waters and me,* for You take away the sin of the world.

Having opened the holy doors, the priest (vested in the phelonion), and the deacon intone:

Deacon: Let us be attentive!
Priest: Peace be to all.
Deacon: Wisdom! Let us be attentive!

Prokimenon: Ps 17 (Tone 4)
The Lord thundered from heaven; the Most High made His voice resound.
Verse: I love You, Lord, my strength, Lord, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer.

Deacon: Wisdom!
Lector: A reading from the Book of Isaiah.
Deacon: Let us be attentive!

Lector: Thus says the Lord: The desert and the parched land will exult; / the steppe will rejoice and bloom. / They will bloom with abundant flowers, / and rejoice with joyful song. / The glory of Lebanon will be given to them, / the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; / They will see the glory of the LORD, / the splendor of our God. / Strengthen the hands that are feeble, / make firm the knees that are weak, / Say to those whose hearts are frightened: / Be strong, fear not! / Here is your God, / he comes with vindication; / With divine recompense / he comes to save you. / Then will the eyes of the blind be opened, / the ears of the deaf be cleared; / Then will the lame leap like a stag, / then the tongue of the dumb will sing. Streams will burst forth in the desert, / and rivers in the steppe. / The burning sands will become pools, / and the thirsty ground, springs of water; / The abode where jackals lurk / will be a marsh for the reed and papyrus. / A highway will be there, / called the holy way; / No one unclean may pass over it / nor fools go astray on it. / No lion will be there, / nor beast of prey go up to be met upon it. / It is for those with a journey to make, / and on it the redeemed will walk. / Those whom the LORD has ransomed will return / and enter Zion singing, / crowned with everlasting joy; / They will meet with joy and gladness, / sorrow and mourning will flee. (35:1-10).

Deacon: Wisdom!
Lector: A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.
Deacon: Let us be attentive!

Lector: “And as John was completing his course, he would say; ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. Behold, one is coming after me; I am not worthy to unfasten the sandals of his feet.’ My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those others among you who are God-fearing, to us this word of salvation has been sent. The inhabitants of Jerusalem and their leaders failed to recognize him, and by condemning him they fulfilled the oracles of the prophets that are read sabbath after sabbath. For even though they found no grounds for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him put to death, and when they had accomplished all that was written about him they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead, and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These are [now] his witnesses before the people. We ourselves are proclaiming this good news to you that what God promised our ancestors. (13:25-32).”

The deacon, having incensed the altar and the people, intones:
Deacon: Wisdom! Let us stand and listen to the holy Gospel;
Priest: Peace be with all.
Choir: And with your spirit.
Priest: A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.
Choir: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You.
Gospel: Mt 3:1-12 (read by the priest alone).
Choir: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You.

The holy doors are closed, and the choir reads:
Let my way be straight according to Your word; let no sin overcome me. Save me from the wickedness of evil-doers, and I will keep Your commandments. Let Your face shine upon Your servants; and teach me your laws.

Let my mouth be filled with Your praise, O Lord, and let me sing Your glory and magnificence all the day long.

Holy God; Trinity most holy; Our Father; and the following Kontakion:

(Tone 4): Today the Lord stood in the waters of the Jordan telling John:* Do not be afraid to baptize Me,* for I have come to save Adam, the first created.

Lord, have mercy (40x).
O Christ our God..., (p. 155).
Lord, have mercy (3x).

Glory be: Now and for ever:
More honorable than the cherubim,* and by far more glorious than the seraphim;* ever a virgin, you gave birth to God, the Word;* O true Mother of God, we magnify you.

Give the blessing, father, in the name of the Lord.

Priest: May God be merciful to us and bless us; may He cause His countenance to shine upon us, and have mercy on us.
Choir: Amen.

Prayer of the First Hour
O Christ, the true Light who enlightens and sanctifies everyone in the world, mark us with the light of Your countenance so that we may see the unapproachable light. Let our life be straight along the path of Your commandments, through the prayers of Your most pure Mother and of all Your saints. Amen.

If the Third Hour is to follow, then it begins as follows: Come let us adore.... Otherwise, the following dismissal is taken:

Priest: Glory be to You, O Christ our God, our hope; glory be to You!
Choir: Glory be: Now and for ever: Lord, have mercy. (3x). Give the blessing!

Priest: Christ our true God, Who deigned to be baptized in the river Jordan by John for our salvation through the prayers of His immaculate Mother, and of our venerable and God-bearing fathers, and of all the saints; will have mercy and save us, for He is good and loves mankind.

THIRD HOUR

Come, let us adore...

Psalm 28

O give the Lord, you sons of God,* give the Lord glory and power;
Give the Lord the glory of His name.* Adore the Lord in His holy court.
The Lord’s voice resounding on the waters,* the Lord on the immensity of waters;
The voice of the Lord, full of power,* the voice of the Lord, full of splendor.
The Lord’s voice shattering the cedars,* the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon;
He makes Lebanon leap like a calf* and Sirion like a young wild-ox.
The Lord's voice flashes flames of fire.* The Lord’s voice shaking the wilderness, the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The Lord’s voice rending the oak tree and stripping the forest bare.* In His temple they all cry: Glory!
The Lord sat enthroned over the flood;* the Lord sits as king for ever.
The Lord will give strength to His people,* the Lord will bless His people with peace.

Psalm 50, (p. 161) and Psalm 41 may also be taken.

Glory be: Now and for ever:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!; Glory be to You, O God. (3x).
Lord, have mercy (3x).

Glory be: (Tone 4): After Elijah had gone up..., (p. 1277).

Now and for ever: O Mother of God, you are the true vine laden with the Fruit of Life; wherefore, we implore you, O Lady, to intercede together with the apostles and all the saints that we may obtain mercy for our souls.

Then the following stichera are sung:

(Tone 8, Samohlasen): The right hand of the Forerunner, baptizer and prophet,* the most venerated of all the prophets,* trembled, when he beheld the Lamb of God,* Who takes away the sins of the world.* Overwhelmed by the awesome task he was about to perform, he said:* I do not dare, O Word, to touch Your head.* You Yourself, O bountiful One, sanctify and enlighten me,* for You are the Life and the Light and the Peace of the world.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): You come, O Lord, as a man in the flesh to the Jordan,* desiring, O Giver of life, to be baptized,* in order to deliver us from the wiles and traps of the serpent, and to enlighten us.* The Father bore witness to You* and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove hovered above You.* Have Him dwell within our souls, O Lover of mankind.

The rest is taken according to the rules as prescribed in the First Hour.

Prokimenon: Ps 76 (Tone 6)
The waters saw You, O God;* the waters saw You and trembled.
Verse: I cry aloud to God, I cry aloud to God, that He may hear me.

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah, (p. 821).
A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.

While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior of the country and came [down] to Ephesus where he found some disciples. He said to them, “Did you receive the holy Spirit when you became believers?” They answered him, “We have never even heard that there is a holy Spirit.” He said, “How were you baptized?” they replied, “With the baptism of John.” Paul then said “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.” When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid [his] hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. Altogether there were about twelve men. He entered the synagogue, and for three months debated boldly with persuasive arguments about the kingdom of God (19:1-8).

Gospel: Mk 1:1-8 – is read by the priest himself.

The holy doors are closed, and the choir reads the following prayer:
Blessed is the Lord God! Blessed is the Lord day by day! May the God of our salvation smooth our path. Our God is the God of salvation.

SIXTH HOUR

Come, let us adore....

Psalm 76

I cry aloud to God, cry aloud to God* that He may hear me.
In the day of my distress I sought the Lord.* My hands were raised at night without ceasing; my soul refused to be consoled.
I remembered my God and I groaned.* I pondered and my spirit fainted.
You withheld sleep from my eyes,* I was troubled, I could not speak.
I thought of the days of long ago* and remembered the years long past.
At night I mused within my heart,* I pondered and my spirit questioned.
Will the Lord reject us forever?* Will He show us his favor no more?
Has his love vanished forever?* Has his promise come to an end?
Does God forget his mercy* or in anger withhold His compassion?
I said: This is what causes my grief;* that the way of the Most High has changed.
I remember the deeds of the Lord;* I remember Your wonders of old.
I muse on all Your works* and ponder Your mighty deeds.
Your ways, O God, are holy.* What God is great as our God?
You are the God Who works wonders.* You showed Your power among the peoples.
Your strong arm redeemed Your people,* the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
The waters saw You, O God, the waters saw You and trembled,* the depths were moved with terror.
The clouds poured down rain, the skies sent forth their voice;* Your arrows flashed to and fro.
Your thunder rolled round the sky,* Your flashes lighted up the world; the earth was moved and trembled.
Your way led through the sea, Your path through the mighty waters;* and no one saw Your footprints.
You guided Your people like a flock* by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Psalms 90, (p. 167), and 73 may also be taken.

Now and for ever: Since we have no one in whom to confide because of our many sins,* O Virgin Mother of God, intercede for us with the One Who was born of you;* for a mother’s prayer is a powerful means for obtaining the Master’s favor.* You are most worthy of veneration,* so do not turn away from the pleading of us sinners;* for the One Who willed to suffer in the flesh for our sake is full of mercy,* and His power is sufficient to save us.

Then we sing the following stichera:

(Tone 8, Samohlasen): The Lord spoke these words to John:* Come and baptize Me, your Creator, O prophet,* for I enlighten and purify all people by grace.* Place your hand on my head and do not doubt.* O prophet, allow it to be this way now,* for I have come to fulfill all justice.* Cast away all your doubt;* for I hasten to put to death the prince of darkness,* the enemy who hides in the waters,* so I may release the world from his hold* and grant eternal life in my love for all.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): O Jordan, why do your waters change course?* Why do your streams stop, and why do you not flow as you should?* The river then answered:* I cannot hold the Fire that consumes me.* I am amazed and awed at his great condescension.* For I am not accustomed to wash Him Who is clean;* I have not learned to bathe the sinless,* but to purify the unclean vessels.* Christ, now baptized in me, teaches me to burn the thorns of sin.* John, the voice of the Word, testifies with me and cries out:* Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world.* O faithful, with a loud voice, let us say:* You are manifested for our salvation; O God, glory to You!

The rest is taken according to the rubrics in the First Hour.

Psalm 113

When Israel came forth from Egypt, Jacob’s sons from an alien people,* Judah became the Lord’s temple, Israel became His kingdom.
The sea fled at the sight;* the Jordan turned back on its course.
The mountains leapt like rams* and the hills like yearling sheep.
Why was it, sea, that you fled,* that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?
Mountains, that you leapt like rams,* hills, like yearling sheep?
Tremble, O earth, before the Lord,* in the presence of the God of Jacob,
Who turns the rock into a pool* and flint into a spring of water.

Glory be: (Tone 4): After Elijah had gone up..., (p. 1277).

Now and for ever: O gracious Lord, for our sake You were born of the Virgin and were crucified.* You crushed Death by Your death,* and, being God, brought forth the resurrection.* Do not turn away from those You have made with Your own hands;* but reveal instead Your love to us, O Lord of mercy.* Accept as intercessor the Virgin Mother of God who gave You birth.* O our Savior, save a desperate people.

Then we sing following stichera:

(Tone 7, Samohlasen): It was astonishing to see at the river Jordan, the Creator of heaven and earth,* Who stripped Himself naked, and, as a servant,* received from a servant baptism for our salvation;* the hosts of angels, filled with fear and joy, were struck with amazement.* With them we also worship You, crying out: Save us!

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): The hand with which you, O Forerunner and baptizer,* touched the most pure head of our Lord and pointed Him out to the people,* stretch out to Him in our behalf, seeing as you have great confidence in Him,* for He said that you are the greatest of all the prophets.* Also raise your eyes to the all-holy Spirit,* Whom they have seen in the form of a dove descending upon Him,* and implore for us, O Baptizer, His grace.* Come and join us; give us the sign to sing and begin a hymn of praise.

The rest is taken according to the typicon prescribed in the First Hour.

A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.
Thus says the LORD: / In a time of favor I answer you, / on the day of salvation I help you, / To restore the land / and allot the desolate heritages, / Saying to the prisoners: Come out! / To those in darkness: Show yourselves! / Along the ways they shall find pasture, / on every bare height shall their pastures be. / They shall not hunger or thirst, / nor shall the scorching wind or the sun strike them; / For he who pities them leads them / and guides them beside springs of water. I will cut a road through all my mountains, / and make my highways level. / See, some shall come from afar, / others from the north and the west, / and some from the land of Syene. Sing out, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth, / break forth into song, you mountains, / For the LORD comforts his people / and shows mercy to his afflicted. But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me; / my Lord has forgotten me.” / Can a mother forget her infant, / be without tenderness for the child of her womb? / Even should she forget, / I will never forget you. (49:8-15).

A reading from the letter of St. Paul to Titus.
Titus my child: For the grace of God has appeared, saving all and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age, as we await the blessed hope, the appearance of the glory of the great God and of our savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people as his own, eager to do what is good. But when the kindness and generous love of God our savior appeared, / not because of any righteous deeds we had done / but because of his mercy, / he saved us through the bath of rebirth / and renewal by the holy Spirit, / whom he richly poured out on us / through Jesus Christ our savior, / so that we might be justified by his grace / and become heirs in hope eternal life. (2:11-14; 3:4-7).

Vespers with the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great

(dark-red vestments)

Blessed is the man... is taken only on Saturday and Sunday evenings.

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 2): When the Forerunner saw the One Who is our enlightenment,* the One Who has brought light to all,* coming to be baptized,* his heart rejoiced, and his hand trembled.* He pointed Him out to the people and said:* This is the Savior of Israel Who delivered us from corruption.* O Christ our God, O sinless One, glory to You!

O our Savior, the armies of angels trembled* when they saw You baptized by Your servant,* and the Holy Spirit bearing witness and descending,* and when they heard the voice of the Father speaking from heaven:* This One upon Whom the Forerunner lays his hands* is my beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased.* O Christ our God, glory to You!

When the Jordan River received You, O Fountainhead,* the Comforter descended in the form of a dove.* Now behold the marvel:* the One Who bowed the heavens bows His head to the Forerunner,* and the one made of clay cries out to His Maker:* Why do You command me to perform what is beyond my power?* It is I who need to be baptized by You.* O Christ our God, O sinless One, glory to You!

O God and Lord, when You resolved to save those who had strayed from You,* You condescended to take the form of a servant,* for it was fitting that You assumed our human nature for us.* And when You were baptized in the flesh, O our Redeemer,* it made us worthy of Your forgiveness.* Therefore, we cry out to You:* O Christ our God, our Benefactor, glory to You!

Upon touching Your immaculate head, the hand of the Baptist trembled.* The streams of the Jordan turned back, feeling unworthy to serve You.* How could the one who stood in awe of Joshua, the son of Nun,* be unafraid to stand before the Creator of Joshua?* You have completed all that was assigned to You, O Savior,* so that You might redeem the world by Your epiphany,* for You alone love the human race.

Desiring to fulfill all that was ordained for You from eternity, O Lord,* You received ministers from all creation at this mystery of Yours:* Gabriel from among the angels, the Virgin from among the human race,* the star from among the heavens,* and Jordan from among the waters;* and in it You have cleansed the sins of the world.* O our Savior, glory to You!

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 2): You have bowed Your head before the Forerunner,* and You have crushed the heads of the demons.* You have descended into the waters and given light to all things* that they may glorify You, O Savior, the Enlightenment of our souls.

The entrance with the Gospel Book; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day; on Friday, the great Prokimenon: What God is great..., (p. 25); and the following readings: Genesis 1:1-13; Exodus 14: 15-29; Exodus 15: 22-27 (see below).

Lector: A reading from the Book of Exodus.

Then Moses led Israel forward from the Red Sea, and they marched out to the desert of Shur. After traveling for three days through the desert without finding water, they arrived in Marah, where they could not drink the water, because it was too bitter. Hence this place was called Marah. As the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” he appealed to the LORD who pointed out to him a certain piece of wood. When he threw this into the water, the water became fresh. It was here that the LORD, in making rules and regulations for them, put them to the test. “If you really listen to the voice of the LORD, your God,” he told them, “and do what is right in his eyes: if you heed his commandments and keep all his precepts, I will not afflict you with any of the diseases with which I afflicted the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer.” Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water. Having set out from Elim the whole Israelite community came into the desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt. (15:22-16: 1).

The priest (deacon or lector) intones the following troparion and verses, and the choir sings the conclusion of this troparion, like a prokimenon:

Troparion (Tone 5): O Creator of the world,* You appeared in the world in order to shine upon those who live in darkness.* O merciful One, glory to You!
Choir: In order to shine upon those who live in darkness, O merciful One, glory to You!
Verse: O God, be gracious and bless us and let Your face shed its light upon us; so that we may know Your ways upon earth and all nations may learn Your saving help.
Choir: In order to shine upon those....
Verse: Let the peoples glorify You, O God, let all the peoples praise You; let them all be happy, for You are the Ruler of all the nations; and You govern them with justice.
Choir: In order to shine upon those....
Glory be: Now and for ever:
Choir: In order to shine upon those....
And again: O Creator of the world....
Choir: In order to shine upon those....

Then the second series of readings follows: Book of Joshua (see below); 2 Kings 2:6-14; 2 Kings 5:9-14.

Lector: A reading from the Book of Joshua.

Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know I am with you, as I was with Moses. Now command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant to come to a halt in the Jordan when they reach the edge of the waters.” No sooner had these priestly bearers of the ark waded into the waters at the edge of the Jordan, which overflows all its banks during the entire season of the harvest, than the waters flowing from upstream halted, backing up in a solid mass for a very great distance indeed, from Adam, a city in the direction of Zarethan; while those flowing downstream toward the Salt Sea of the Arabah disappeared entirely. Thus the people crossed over opposite Jericho. While all Israel crossed over on dry ground, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD remained motionless on dry ground in the bed of the Jordan until the whole nation had completed the passage. (3:7-8, 15-17).

The priest (deacon or lector) intones the following troparion and verses, and the choir sings the concluding words of this troparion like a prokimenon.

Troparion (Tone 6): O our Savior, through the greatness of your mercy,* You cleansed the sinners and the publicans,* and now Your light shines upon those who live in darkness.* O Lord, glory to You!
Choir: And now Your light shines upon those who live in darkness. O Lord, glory to You!
Verse: The Lord is King, in majesty enrobed; the Lord has robed Himself with might; He has girded Himself with power. The world will surely stand in place, never to be moved. Your throne stands from old; You are from everlasting, Lord.
Choir: And now Your light shines upon those....
Verse: The floods have lifted up, O Lord; the waters have lifted up their voice; the waters have lifted up their thunder.
Choir: And now Your light shines upon those....
Glory be: Now and for ever:
Choir: And now Your light shines upon those....
And again: O our Savior, through the greatness of Your mercy....
Choir: And now Your light shines upon those....

Then the third series of readings: Isaiah 1:16-20 (see below); Genesis 32: 2-11; Exodus 2: 5-10; Judges 6: 36-40; 1 Kings 18: 30-39; 2 Kings 2: 19-22; Isaiah 49: 8-15.

Lector: A reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.

Thus says the Lord: / Wash yourselves clean! / Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes; / cease doing evil; learn to do good. / Make justice your aim: redress the wronged, / hear the orphan’s plea, defend the widow. Come now, let us set things right, / says the LORD: / Though your sins be like scarlet, / they may become white as snow; / Though they be crimson red, / they may become white as wool. / If you are willing, and obey, / you shall eat the good things of the land; / But if you refuse and resist, / the sword shall consume you; / for the mouth of the LORD has spoken! (1: 16-20).

The deacon intones the small litany:

Again and again, in peace let us pray to the Lord.
Help and save, have mercy and protect us, O God, by Your grace.
Remembering our most holy and immaculate, most blessed and glorious Lady, the Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, together with all the saints, let us commend ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

Priest: For You are holy our God, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever:
Deacon: And ever.
Choir: Amen. Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal, have mercy on us. – The rest is the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great.

Prokimenon: Ps 26 (Tone 3)
The Lord is my light and Savior; whom shall I fear?
Verse: The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

Lector: A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians.

Brethren: Although I am free in regard to all, I have made myself a slave to all so as to win over as many as possible. To the Jews I became like a Jew to win over Jews; to those under the law I became like one under the law – though I myself am not under the law – to win over those under the law. To those outside the law I became like one outside the law – though I am not outside God’s law but within the law of Christ – to win over those outside the law. To the weak I became weak, to win over the weak. I have become all things to all, to save at least some. All this I do for the sake of the gospel, so that I too may have a share in it. Do you not know that the runners in the stadium all run in the race, but only one wins the prize? Run so as to win. Every athlete exercises discipline in every way. They do it to win a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one. Thus do not run aimlessly; I do not fight as if I were shadowboxing. No, I drive my body and train it, for fear that, having preached to others, I myself should be disqualified. (I, 9: 19-27).

Alleluia: Ps 44 (Tone 4)
My heart overflows with noble words. To the king I must speak the song I have made.
Verse: You are the fairest of the children, and graciousness is poured upon your lips, because God has blessed you forevermore.

Gospel: Lk 3:1-8.
Instead of It is truly right... the choir sings: In you, O Woman Full of Grace....
Communion Verse: Praise the Lord from the heavens. Praise him in the highest. Alleluia (3x).

After the prayer behind the ambo we begin the blessing of water, (p. 831).

After Blessed be the name of the Lord...: Psalm 33 and the dismissal. After the dismissal the two choirs stand in the middle of the church and sing the troparion and kontakion of the Theophany, (p. 1278).

Note: If Vespers is celebrated on Saturday or Sunday evening without the Divine Liturgy, then Holy God... is omitted. After the Gospel which the priests himself reads (the deacon reads the Gospel only at the Divine Liturgy): the litany Let us all say...; Deign, Q Lord...; the litany Let us complete our evening prayer...; then the blessing of water begins, (p. 831). At the end: Wisdom... and the great dismissal.

GREAT COMPLINE WITH LITIYA

Great Compline is celebrated according to the rules given on pp. 64-82; then we sing the following stichera of Litiya; the rest as on Vespers with Litiya, from (p. 31).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 4): The One Who clothes Himself with light as with a robe* deigned, for our sakes, to become as we are.* Today He is clothed in the streams of the Jordan* even though He has no need to be purified.* He refashions us through the cleansing that He receives.* What a marvelous wonder!* He creates anew without fire* and refashions without tearing apart;* He grants salvation to those enlightened in Him,* Christ our God, the Savior of our souls.

Today Christ is baptized;* He emerges from the waters and uplifts the world with Him.* He beholds the opening of the heavens* which Adam had closed for himself and his descendants.* The Spirit testifies to His divine nature,* for He is in accord with His own. A voice is heard from the heavens,* giving witness to the One Who has descended;* for He is the Savior of our souls.

Upon touching Your immaculate head,* the hand of the Baptist trembled.* The streams of the Jordan turned back,* feeling unworthy to serve You.* If the waters trembled before Joshua, the son of Nun,* why should they not shudder before their Creator?* You have completed all that was assigned to You, O Savior,* so that You might redeem the world by Your Epiphany;* for You alone love the human race.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): Today all creation is enlightened.* Today all nature rejoices,* those in heaven and those upon the earth.* Angels and people join together* in the presence of the King and His army.* Let us hasten to the Jordan;* let us witness to John as he baptizes a sinless and uncreated head.* Let us sing out in one voice,* echoing that of the apostle:* The grace of God which brings salvation to all has come forth,* enlightening the faithful and granting them great mercy.

Aposticha

(Tone 2): O Lord, when John saw You approaching him at the Jordan River, he cried out:* How do You, O Lord Who are sinless, come to me Your servant?* In whose name shall I baptize You?* In the name of the Father Whom You possess in Yourself?* In the name of the Son, while You are the very Son in the flesh?* In the name of the Holy Spirit Whom You grant to the faithful* with the breath of Your mouth?* O God Who has appeared to us, have mercy on us.

Verse: The sea fled at the sight; the Jordan turned back on its course.

The waters have seen You.* When the waters saw You, O Lord, they trembled,* for the very Cherubim do not dare to look upon Your glory,* nor can the Seraphim rest their eyes upon You.* They stand in awe before You,* some on guard, others glorifying Your might.* Together with them, we proclaim Your praise, O merciful One, and say:* O God Who has appeared to us, have mercy on us.

Verse: Why was it, O sea, that you fled, that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?

Today the Creator of heaven and earth* approaches the Jordan River in the flesh;* the One Who is free from sin seeks to be baptized* in order to cleanse the human race from the error of the enemy;* the Master of all is baptized at the hand of the servant* in order to grant us the cleansing through water.* Therefore, let us cry out to Him:* O God Who has appeared to us, glory to You!

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): When John, the bright lamp that was born of a barren mother,* perceived that Christ, the Sun Who had risen from a virgin,* was now asking for baptism, he cried out with joy:* O Lord, sanctify me by Your Theophany.

Canticle of Simeon; Holy God; Trinity most holy; Our Father; the troparion of the feast: At your baptism in the Jordan, O Lord..., (p. 1278); then the blessing of bread; Psalm 33; and the great dismissal.

After Psalm 50:
Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 2): All creation is filled with joy today;* Christ has appeared in the Jordan.

Verse: Have mercy on me, God, in Your kindness, in Your compassion, blot out my offense.

(Tone 6): God the Word manifested Himself in the flesh to the human race.* He stood in the Jordan to be baptized,* and the Forerunner said to Him:* How can I extend my hand and touch the head of Him Who governs all things?* Even though You were an infant born of Mary,* I know that You are the eternal God.* You are praised by the Seraphim and yet You walk on earth,* and the servant has not learned how to baptize the Master.* O ineffable Lord, glory to You!

Canon (Tone 2)

Hirmos 1: The Lord, powerful in battle, separated the foundations of the sea and led His servants across on dry ground. But He covered their enemies with the waters, for He is covered with glory.

Hirmos 3: The Lord, Who bestows power to kings and raises up the strength of His anointed, is born of a Virgin and now draws near for baptism. Therefore, let us, the faithful, cry out: No one is as holy as our God, and no one is as righteous as You, O Lord.

Hirmos 4: O Lord, he whom You called the voice of one crying in the wilderness, heard Your voice when You thundered upon the waters, bearing witness to Your Son. Having been filled with the Spirit, he cried out: You are Christ, the wisdom and power of God.

Hirmos 5: Jesus, the Prince of life, has come to set free Adam, the first-created; and although as God He has no need of cleansing, for the sake of the fallen human race He is cleansed in the Jordan. He destroyed the enemy in the waters and grants the peace that is beyond all understanding.

Hirmos 6: The voice of the Word, the candlestick of Light, the morning star, and forerunner of the Sun, proclaimed in the wilderness to all peoples: Repent and be purified while time still remains. For behold, Christ is at hand, the One Who delivers the world from corruption.

Hirmos 7: As they walked about in the fiery furnace, the three youths were preserved from all harm by the presence of an angel of God and the refreshing wind as cool as dew. Strengthened with these helps, they gratefully cried out: Blessed are You and praise above all, O God of our fathers.

Hirmos 8: As the Babylonian furnace poured forth dew, it prefigured a wondrous mystery: how the Jordan received in its streams the immaterial fire and encircled the Creator when He was baptized in the flesh. All you faithful, glorify and praise Him above all forever.

Ode 9: The Magnificat is omitted; but immediately after the intonation: Let us greatly extol the Theotokos..., the choir sings the 9th hirmos with its verse.

Verse: O my soul, extol the Lord, who is being baptized in the Jordan river.

Hirmos (Tone 2): No tongue is capable of praising you worthily, and no mind, however superhuman, is able to extol you, O Mother of God. Good as you are, accept our faith, for you know our love of God. You are the guide of Christians, and we glorify you.

Verse: Glory be to Your holy baptism, O Lord!

O my soul, extol the One Who comes to the Jordan to be baptized. O David, come in spirit to those who are now to be baptized, and sing: Draw near to God in faith and receive enlightenment. The fallen Adam cried out in his poverty to the Lord and received a listening ear; He has come to the waters of the Jordan, thereby refashioning Adam who had fallen into corruption.

Verse: Glory be to Your holy baptism, O Lord!

Isaiah said: Wash yourselves clean! Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes. All you thirsty, come to the water; for Christ will wash with the water of renewal those who run to Him in faith, and He baptizes them with the Spirit Who will provide them with eternal life.

Glory be: Now and for ever: O eternal King! Having cleansed human nature with the pure waters of the Jordan, You perfect it in Confirmation by the imparting of the Holy Spirit, so that, having brought low the arrogant power of darkness, you may replace it with everlasting life.

Verse: O my soul, extol the Virgin, the most pure Mother of God, Who is greater in honor than the hosts on high.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 2): The wonder of your birth surpasses all understanding, O most pure Virgin, for through you, O blessed Mother, we received perfect salvation. We, therefore, fittingly extol you, our benefactress, and offer you a hymn of thanksgiving.

Exapostilarion: The Savior, Who is grace and truth, has been revealed in the waters of the Jordan;* and He shed light upon those who sleep in darkness and shadow.* The Light to Whom no one can draw near is revealed today.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 1): Christ our God is revealed today;* as Light from Light He shines upon the world.* All you faithful, let us bow down before Him.

O Christ our Master,* as servants, how can we praise You in a fitting manner?* For You have renewed us in the waters.

O Savior, You were baptized in the Jordan and have sanctified the waters.* By submitting Your head to the hand of a servant,* You healed the passions of the world.* How unspeakable is the mystery of Your plan of salvation.* O Lord Who loves all people, glory to You!

Glory be: Now and for ever: The true Light has appeared to bestow enlightenment upon all.* The all-pure Christ is baptized with us;* He sanctifies the water and it becomes a cleansing for our souls.* All that which appears outward and visible is earthly;* and that which is understood by the mind is greater than the heavens.* Salvation is bestowed through washing,* and the Spirit is received through water.* By descending into the water we ascend to God.* How wonderful are Your works, O Lord, glory to You!

After the great doxology: troparion of the feast, (p. 1278); the litanies, and the great dismissal.

THE GREAT BLESSING OF WATER

After the prayer behind the ambo, at the Divine Liturgy, we go to the place where the water blessing is to be performed. The priest (always fully vested), with the holy cross in his right hand, is preceded by the candlebearers with lighted candles and censer and the deacon bearing the Gospel.

Instead of Blessed be the name of the Lord..., the choir sings the following stichera:

(Tone 8): The voice of the Lord resounds over the waters, saying:* Come and receive the spirit of wisdom,* the spirit of understanding,* the spirit of the fear of God* from this revelation of Christ.

Today the nature of water is sanctified.* The Jordan is parted;* its waters cease to flow when it sees its Master being baptized.

O Christ our King, You came as a man into the river.* For our sins, O loving and blessed Lord,* You desired to be baptized like a servant* by the hands of the Forerunner.

Glory be: Now and for ever: To the voice of the one crying in the wilderness:* Prepare the way of the Lord;* You came, O Lord, as a servant* seeking to be baptized even though You had no sin.* When the waters saw You, they trembled in fear* like the Forerunner who exclaimed:* How can a lamp give light to the Light?* How can a servant touch his Master?* Rather, O Savior, bless the waters and me,* for You take away the sin of the world.

Having placed the holy cross and the Gospel Book on the prepared table, the priest incenses it on all four sides, also the water and the people; then the deacon intones:

Deacon: Wisdom!
Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.
Deacon: Let us be attentive!

Lector: Thus says the LORD: “With joy you will draw water at the fountain of salvation, and say on that day: Give thanks to the LORD, acclaim his name; among the nations make known his deeds, proclaim how exalted is his name. Sing praise to the LORD for his glorious achievement; let this be known throughout all the earth. Shout with exultation, O city of Zion, for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel!” (12: 3-6).

Other readings: Isaiah 35: 1-10 (p. 804); Isaiah 55: 1-13.

Deacon: Let us be attentive!
Priest: Peace be with you.
Deacon: Wisdom! Let us be attentive!

Prokimenon: Ps 26 (Tone 3)
The Lord is my light and my Savior;* whom shall I fear?
Verse: The Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

Deacon: Wisdom!
Lector: A reading from the first letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians.
Deacon: Let us be attentive!

Lector: Brethren: I do not want you to be unaware, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea, and all of them were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was the Christ (1 Cor 10:1-4).

Alleluia: Psalms 28 and 113 (Tone 4)
The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the Lord is over many waters.
Verse: Why was it, O sea, that you fled, that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?

Before the reading of the Gospel, the deacon incenses the table on all four sides, the water, the priest, and the people, then intones:

Deacon: Wisdom! Let us stand and listen to the holy Gospel!
Priest: Peace be with all.
Priest: A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.
Choir: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You!
Deacon: Let us be attentive!

Priest: At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John. On coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him. And a voice came from the heavens, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” (1: 9-11).

Choir: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You.

Then the deacon immediately intones the litany:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.
Choir: Lord, have mercy (after each petition).

That these waters may be sanctified by the power, operation, and descent of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord.

That there may descend upon these waters the purifying action of the most substantial Trinity, let us pray to the Lord.

That this water may be endowed with the grace of redemption, the blessing of the Jordan, through the power and action and descent of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord.

That Satan may speedily be crushed under our feet, and that every evil council directed against us fail, let us pray to the Lord.

That the Lord our God free us from every deceit and temptation of the enemy, and render us worthy of the good things He has promised, let us pray to the Lord.

That we be enlightened by the light of understanding and of piety through the blessed descent of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord.

That the Lord our God send down the blessing of the Jordan and sanctify these waters, let us pray to the Lord.

That this water be a gift of sanctification, of remission of sins, of healing of soul and body, and of every expedient need, let us pray to the Lord.

That this water be a fountain welling up to eternal life, let us pray to the Lord.

That this water may manifest its power in averting every snare of our enemies, visible and invisible, let us pray to the Lord.

For those who shall use it for the sanctification of their homes, let us pray to the Lord.

That it may serve as a purification of the souls and bodies of all those who, with faith, shall draw and partake of it, let us pray to the Lord.

That we be perfectly sanctified by partaking of these waters, through the invisible manifestation of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord.

That the Lord hear the voice of our supplication and have mercy on us, let us pray to the Lord.

That we be delivered from all affliction, wrath and need, let us pray to the Lord.

Protect us, save us, have mercy on us, and preserve us, O God, by Your grace.

Remembering our most holy, immaculate, most blessed and glorious Lady, the Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, with all the saints, let us commend ourselves and one another, and our whole life to Christ our God.

Choir: To You, O Lord.

As the litany is being said, the priest says the following prayer quietly:

O Lord Jesus Christ, only-begotten Son, ever-present with the Father, true God, Source of life and immortality, Light from Light, Who have come into the world to enlighten it! Enlighten our minds with Your Holy Spirit and receive us, who bring to You our praise and thanks: for Your great and wondrous deeds from all eternity and for Your plan of salvation in recent ages, when You clothed Yourself in our poor and weak mortality and descended to the rank of a servant, O King of all. You, being sinless, accepted baptism in the Jordan from the hand of a servant, so that, having sanctified the very nature of water, You could establish for us a way of rebirth by water and the Spirit and restore us to our previous dignity. Recalling this divine mystery, we pray to You, Master and Lover of mankind; sprinkle us, too, Your unworthy children, according to Your divine promise, with pure water, by the gift of Your mercy, so that the prayer of us sinners over this water, by Your goodness, may be pleasing and Your blessing may be given to it and to us, and to all your faithful people, to the glory of Your holy and honorable Name.

Exclamation: For all glory, honor and worship is Yours, with Your eternal Father and Your most holy, blessed and life-creating Spirit, now and for ever and ever.
Choir: Amen.

After the litany, the priest says the following prayer aloud:

We glorify You, O Master and Lover of mankind, almighty King Who are eternal! We glorify You, O Creator and Maker of all! We glorify You, O only-begotten Son, Who were born of a mother without a father and of a father without a mother, for in the preceding feast we have seen You as a babe, and in this present feast as perfect man appearing as our perfect God. Today is the time of feasting, and the ranks of saints and angels have joined us in celebration; today the grace of the all-holy Spirit in the likeness of a dove comes down upon the waters; today shines the Sun that never sets, and the world is sparkling with the light of the Lord; today the moon is bright, together with the earth in the glowing radiance of its beams; today the brilliant stars adorn the universe with the splendor of its twinkling; today the clouds from heaven shed upon man a shower of justice; today the Uncreated willingly permits the hands of His creature to be laid upon Him; today the prophet and Forerunner approaches the Lord and, standing before Him in awe, witnesses the condescension of God towards us; today through the presence of the Lord the waters of the river Jordan are changed into remedies; today the whole universe is refreshed with mystical streams; today the sins of mankind are blotted out by the waters of the river Jordan; today paradise has been opened to mankind, and the Sun of righteousness has shone upon us; today at the hands of Moses, the bitter water is changed into sweetness by the presence of the Lord. Today we are delivered from the ancient mourning, and like a new Israel, we are saved; today we are delivered from darkness, and, through the light of the knowledge of God, we are illuminated; today the darkness of the world vanishes with the appearing of our God; today the whole creation is brightened from on high; today errors are destroyed and a way of salvation is prepared for us by the coming of the Lord; today the inhabitants of heaven rejoice with those of the earth; and the inhabitants of earth with those of heaven; today the noble and eloquent assembly of the faithful rejoices; today the Lord comes to be baptized, so that mankind may be lifted up; today the One Who never has to bow inclines Himself before His servant so that He may release our chains; today we have acquired the kingdom of heaven; indeed, the kingdom of heaven that has no end. Today land and sea share in the joy of the world, and the world is filled with rejoicing. The waters behold You, O Lord; the waters behold You, and they fear; the river Jordan turns back its course as it beholds the fire of the Godhead coming down upon it and entering it in the flesh; the river Jordan turns back its course as it beholds the Holy Spirit descending in the likeness of a dove, and hovering over You; the river Jordan turns back its course as it beholds the Invisible made visible, the Creator existing in the flesh, and the Master in the likeness of a servant; the river Jordan turns back its course, and the mountains leap with joy as they behold God in the flesh. And the clouds give voices, and are filled with awe by the One Who is coming, Light of Light, true God of true God; the One Who, in the river Jordan, has drowned the death of sin, the thorn of error, and the bonds of hell, and granted the baptism of salvation to the world. So also I, Your unworthy and sinful servant overcome with fear, proclaim Your great wonders; and I cry reverently to You and say:

With the lighted candles the priest makes the sign of the cross in the water, thrice, saying aloud each time:

Great are You, O Lord, and wonderful are Your works, no word can do justice to the praise of Your wonders (3x).

By Your divine will You bring forth all things out of nothingness into being; by Your might You control all creation, by Your providence You govern the universe. You, Who, from four elements, established the whole world, and with four seasons crowned the cycle of the year! The immaterial powers tremble before You, the sun praises You, and the moon is your worshipper; the stars are your servants, and light bows to Your will; the tempests tremble, and the springs adore You. You spread out the heavens like a tent; You set the land upon the waters; You fringed the seas with sandy beaches; You let the air flow about for our breathing. To You are all the hosts of spirits bowing: For You are worshipped by the ranks of the archangels, by the many-eyed Cherubim, by the six-winged Seraphim, as they stand in Your presence and fly about You, covering themselves out of fear of Your unapproachable glory. And You, O God while remaining boundless, without beginning; and beyond all words, deigned to come down upon earth, to assume the likeness of a servant, and become like man. Heeding the depth of Your compassion, O Master, You could not bear to see humanity defeated by the devil, and so You came to save us: for we declare that grace and mercy belong to You, and we do not make a secret of Your goodness. You freed the children of our nature, and through your birth You sanctified the virginal womb; as You make yourself known, all creation sings Your praises for You appeared on earth, O God, and walked among men. You sanctified the course of the river Jordan by sending upon it Your all-holy Spirit, and crushed the head of every dragon nestling in it.

With his hand, the priest makes the sign of the cross in the water, thrice, saying each time:

Wherefore, O King and Lover of Mankind, come down now through the descent of your Holy Spirit, and sanctify this water (3x).

Grant it the grace of giving redemption, and the sanctifying power of the river Jordan. Make it a font of incorruptibility, a gift of sanctification, a redemption from sins, a healing potion for illness, a destroyer of devils, make it hold back the powers of the enemy, and fill it with the might of the angels, so that all who drink and receive of it may be blessed in their souls and bodies, healed of their sufferings, sanctified in their homes, and may receive every befitting grace. For You are our God, Who, with water and the Spirit, restored the youthfulness of our nature made old by sin. You are our God, Who drowned sin in the waters of the time of Noah. You are our God, Who, in the sea, and at the hands of Moses, delivered the Hebrews from the bondage of Pharaoh. You are our God, Who cleaved the rock in the wilderness, so that the waters gushed out, and the valleys overflowed, and the people were satisfied. You are our God, Who, with fire and water and at the hands of Elias, delivered Israel from the errors of Baal.

With his breath, the priest makes the sign of the cross over the water, thrice, saying each time:

Wherefore, O Master, now sanctify this water by Your Holy Spirit (3x).

Grant sanctification, blessing, cleansing, and health to all those who touch it, and to those who shall partake thereof, and to those who shall anoint themselves herewith. And save, O Lord, our God-protected people, keep them in peace under Your protection; bestow upon them whatever they ask unto salvation and eternal life. So, by the elements, by the angels and by men, by things visible and invisible, may Your most holy name be glorified, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always, and for ever and ever.

Choir: Amen.
Priest: Peace be with all.
Choir: And with our Spirit.
Deacon: Bow your heads to the Lord.
Choir: To You, O Lord.

Then the priest, bowing his head, prays quietly: Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear us. You Who sanctified water when You consented to be baptized in the river Jordan: bless us all who, through the bowing of our heads, have signified our servitude and make us worthy to be filled with Your sanctification through the reception and the sprinkling of this water. Let it be, O Lord, for the health of our soul and body. For You are the sanctification of our souls and bodies, and we give to You glory, thanksgiving, and worship, together with Your all-holy, gracious, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever.

Choir: Amen.

Then immediately the priest makes the sign of the cross over the water with the cross; then he holds the cross upright in both hands, plunges it into the water, and lifts it up once again, three times, each time singing the troparion:

(Tone 1): At Your baptism in the Jordan, O Lord, the worship of the Trinity was revealed, for the Father’s voice bore witness to You by calling You His “beloved Son;” and the Spirit in the form of a dove confirmed these words, O Christ God, Who appeared and enlightened the world, glory be to You!

Having filled the aspergillum with holy water, the priest, holding the holy cross in his left hand, sprinkles the people while the choir sings the following stichera:

(Tone 6): O believers, let us praise the great plans of God Who works for us; for the only pure and spotless One, being incarnate on account of our fall, purifies us in the river Jordan, sanctifies us together with the waters, and crushes the heads of dragons in this water. O faithful, let us therefore draw water with joy, for those who draw it in faith shall be invisibly endowed with the grace of the Spirit, through the presence of Christ God, the Savior of our souls.

The priest, returning to the church, blesses everywhere, as the choir sings:
Choir: Blessed be the name of the Lord, now and for ever (3x); then Psalm 33.

Returning to the altar, the deacon places the Gospel Book in its customary place, and the priest blesses the faithful:
Priest: The blessing of the Lord be upon you through His grace and loving-kindness, now and ever and forever:
Choir: Amen.
Priest: Glory be to You, O Christ, our God, our hope, glory be to You!
Choir: Glory be: Now and for ever: Lord, have mercy (3x). Give the blessing.

Priest: Christ our true God, Who was graciously pleased to accept baptism from John in the Jordan for the sake of our salvation, through the prayers of His immaculate Mother, and of all the saints, will have mercy and save us, for He is good and loves mankind.
Choir: Amen.

JANUARY 7-14
POSTFEAST: THEOPHANY OF OUR LORD
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 8): In Your humanity You presented Yourself* to John in the Jordan, O Lord,* although You did not leave Your heavenly throne.* You were seated with the Father,* yet You were baptized for us.* Since You are generous and the Lover of mankind,* You have freed the world from slavery to the enemy.

In Your humanity You clothed Yourself* in the waters of the Jordan, O Lord.* You were given witness from on high* by the descent of the Spirit;* and the voice of the Father testified that You are His Son.* Now manifest Yourself to us* and grant incorruption to our souls.

O Lord, from all eternity* You were begotten in an unchangeable way from the Father.* In latter times You came and received the likeness of a servant.* As the Creator You also renewed our likeness,* for in Your baptism You granted incorruption to our souls.

Three stichera and Glory be: of the saint.

Now and for ever: (Tone 2): Today the Creator of heaven and earth* approaches the Jordan River in the flesh;* the One Who is free from sin seeks to be baptized* in order to cleanse the human race from the error of the enemy;* the Master of all is baptized at the hand of the servant* in order to grant us the cleansing through water.* Therefore, let us cry out to Him:* O God who has appeared to us, glory to You.

On Friday and Saturday evenings, the Dogmaticon of the tone of the week is taken.

Aposticha

(Tone 8): O Lord and sinless One,* although You allowed Yourself to be baptized in the flesh to free the world from sin,* nevertheless we glorify You,* knowing that You are God;* for You were baptized and delivered our souls from slavery.

Verse: The sea fled at the sight; the Jordan turned back on its course.

O Lord, when You became incarnate* and came into the currents of the Jordan* in order to sanctify the water by Your glorious baptism,* You condescended to bow Your head to John,* and You were baptized by a servant in order that You might save our souls.

Verse: Why was it, O sea, that you fled, that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?

O Lord, You desired to save from error* the whole world which You created,* and You deigned to become incarnate from an inviolate virgin.* As the Lover of mankind, You saved Adam from corruption.* You were baptized and bestowed enlightenment on our souls.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 4): Let us imitate the wise virgins;* come, let us go to meet the Master Who is now present,* for He approaches John as a bridegroom.* When the Jordan saw Him, it bowed down in fear and stopped;* John spoke out, saying: I am unworthy to touch Your immortal head.* The Spirit descended in the form of a dove and sanctified the waters,* and a voice was heard from on high:* This is my Son who comes into the world to save all.* O Lord, glory to You!

Troparion of the saint, Glory be: Now and for ever: Troparion of the feast, (p. 1278).

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 4): The great Forerunner seeing that You, Christ,* wished to be baptized in the waters of the Jordan, cried out in joy:* You have come and have appeared to us,* O unapproachable Light!

(Tone 4): O God Who are moved by Your bountifulness,* in Your merciful love, O Lover of mankind,* You went out to seek the lost and doomed sheep.* For this reason, You came to the river Jordan and revealed the mystery of the Most Holy Trinity.* We sing praises to You with faith, and we cry:* You have come and appeared to us, O inaccessible Light!

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): The Ruler of all appeared to us mystically in the streams of the Jordan,* so that, as the merciful and all-good One,* He may wash away all sin.* Let all creation rejoice, for Christ the Lord is baptized,* Who, as God, wished to save the human race.

Canon – Ode 9

Hirmos (Tone 2): The wonder of your birth surpasses all understanding, O most pure Virgin Maiden, for through you, O blessed Mother, we have received perfect salvation. We fittingly extol you also as our Benefactress by bringing to you, as a gift, a hymn of thanksgiving.

Verse: Glory to Your holy baptism, O Lord!

The seal of grace will preserve us, the faithful, as it did once the Hebrews, who have avoided destruction through the smearing of blood on the doorposts. Just as at the Exodus, may this divine bath be for us a spiritual regeneration, so that we may be able to see the neversetting light of the Trinity.

Verse: Glory to Your holy baptism, O Lord!

We have seen that which was revealed to Moses in the unburning bush for it was fulfilled in wonderful decrees: how the Virgin bore the Fire, by giving birth to the light-bearing Benefactor, Who appeared in the streams of the Jordan.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Out of mercy the Savior of the world became a human being, accepting birth in the flesh. Being the only Lover of mankind, above all others, He appeared from out of your virginal womb, O most blessed Mother of God.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 2): No tongue is capable of praising you worthily, and no mind, however superhuman, is able to extol you, O Mother of God. Good as you are, accept our faith, for you know our love of God. You are the guide of Christians, and we glorify you.

Exapostilarion: The Savior, Who is grace and truth, appeared in the waters of the Jordan; and He shed His light upon those who sleep in darkness and shadow. The Light to Whom no one can draw near is revealed today.

Aposticha

(Tone 2, Podoben – Dome Ephratov): A great and awesome* mystery is being unfolded:* for the Ruler of all* is being baptized by a servant,* in order to purify the human race.

Verse: The sea fled at the sight; the Jordan turned back on its course.

The Father* spoke from heaven:* This is my beloved Son,* Who today is being baptized in the flesh* in the waters of the Jordan.

Verse: Why is it, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back?

The choir of angels,* sang in wonder,* when they beheld the Ruler of all* assume the likeness of a servant* and being baptized in the Jordan.

Glory be: Now and for ever: O Savior Who clothes Yourself in light as with a cloak,* You have clothed Yourself in the waters of the Jordan.* You once measured the heavens with a span;* now You bow Your head to the Forerunner* that You might convert the world from sin and save our souls.

JANUARY 30
THE THREE BISHOPS
Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, & John Chrysostom
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 4, Podoben – Jako Dobl’a): Let us glorify the three great preachers of the Trinity,* the instruments of grace and harps of the Spirit,* renowned trumpets of divine preaching* who thundered awesome wonders which were revealed from on high.* John, Basil, and Gregory made known the glory of God* to the ends of the earth.

Let us, who follow their teachings,* loudly sing and praise these instruments of the Holy Spirit.* They are the true trumpets and orators of the Word.* Let us pray to them since they find favor with the Lord,* that He may grant a strong and lasting universal peace* and forgiveness to all of us.

(Tone 2, Podoben – Kijmy pokhvalnnymy): With what praiseworthy crowns shall we crown the teachers, distinct in body but joined together in the Spirit? They are the God-bearing defenders of the Trinity, the triad of ministers, the luminaries who enlighten the world, and pillars of the Church. Because they conquered all, Christ our God mercifully gave them crowns of glory.

With what praiseworthy crowns shall we crown John the Golden-mouthed, Basil, and Gregory? They are precious vessels of the Spirit and firm defenders of the faith, pillars of the Church, the foundation of the faithful, and comfort of sinners. We honor them as wellsprings which overflow, refreshing our souls with water. They ask forgiveness for our sins and great mercy for us.

(Tone 6): Having come together with songs of praise, O lovers of feasts, let us praise the bishops of Christ and the glory of the fathers, the pillars of the faith, the teachers and defenders of the faithful. Let us cry out to them: Rejoice, O luminary of the Church and immutable pillar, O wise Basil. Rejoice, O heavenly mind and great hierarch, Gregory the Theologian. Rejoice, O golden-voiced John, splendid preacher of penance. O thrice-blessed fathers, never cease to pray to Christ in behalf of those who with faith and love observe your sacred and sublime feast.

Rejoice, O trinity of bishops, earthly suns of the firmament, rays and luminaries from the splendor of the Triune Sun, the enlightenment of those who are in darkness, the most fragrant flowers of paradise. O theologian, wise Basil, and John Chrysostom, O tablets for the writings of the Spirit, O God-inspired tablets and ornaments of wisdom, intercede with Christ to send down great mercy to our souls.

Glory be: (Tone 6): Let us extol today those mystical trumpets of the Spirit, the God-mantled Fathers, who, speaking of divine things, sang a unifying hymn in the midst of the Church: teaching that the Trinity is One, not differing in substance or Godhead; refuting Arius and contending for the true faith; and who always intercede with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

Now and for ever: (Dogmaticon, Tone 6, p. 331); on Friday and Saturday: the Dogmaticon of the tone of the week.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; and readings.

Lector: A reading from the Book of Wisdom.

But the just live forever, and in the LORD is their recompense, / and the thought of them is with the Most High. / Therefore shall they receive the splendid crown, the beauteous diadem, from the hand of the LORD, / for he shall shelter them with his right hand, and protect them with his arm. / He shall take his zeal for armor and he shall arm creation to requite the enemy; / He shall don justice for a breastplate / and shall wear sure judgment for a helmet; / He shall take invincible rectitude as a shield / and whet his sudden anger for a sword, / And the universe shall war with him against the foolhardy. / Well-armed shafts of lightnings shall go forth / and from the clouds as from a well-drawn bow shall leap to the mark; / and as from his sling, wrathful hailstones shall be hurled. / The water of the sea shall be enraged against them / and the streams shall abruptly overflow; / A mighty wind shall confront them / and a tempest winnow them out; / Thus lawlessness shall lay the whole earth waste / and evildoing overturn the thrones of potentates. Hear, therefore, kings and understand; / learn, you magistrates of the earth’s expanse! / Hearken, you who are in power over the multitude / and lord it over throngs of peoples! / Because authority was given you by the LORD / and sovereignty by the Most High, / who shall probe your works and scrutinize your counsels! (5: 15-6:3).

Other readings: Deuteronomy (1: 8-17), (p. 720); Deuteronomy (10: 14-21), (p. 900); Wisdom (3:1-9), (p. 744).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 2): Come, let us praise the earthly trinity of holy bishops* who are ministers of the heavenly Trinity:* Basil, whose name means the kingdom;* Gregory, called the Theologian; and John, the Golden-mouthed.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; and readings.

Lector: A reading from the Book of Exodus.

On that same day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt,... the LORD spoke to Moses and said, “Consecrate to me every first-born that opens the womb among Israelites, both of man and beast, for it belongs to me.” Moses said to the people, “Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, that place of slavery. It was with a strong hand that the LORD brought you away. Nothing made with leaven must be eaten.” When the LORD, your God, has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, which he swore to you and your fathers he would give you, you shall dedicate to the LORD every son that opens the womb; and all the male firstlings of your animals shall belong to the LORD. Tell the Israelites: When a woman has conceived and gives birth to a boy, she shall be unclean for seven days, with the same uncleanness as at her menstrual period. On the eighth day, the flesh of the boy’s foreskin shall be circumcised. “When the days of her purification for a son or a daughter are fulfilled, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the meeting tent a yearling lamb for a holocaust and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering. If, however, she cannot afford a lamb, she may take two turtledoves or two pigeons, the one for a holocaust and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and thus she will again be clean.” (Exodus 12:51-13:3,11-12; Leviticus 12:2-3,6,8).

Other readings: Isaiah 6: 1-12; Isaiah 19:1,3-5, 12, 16, 19-22).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 1): The Ancient of Days, Who of old gave the Law to Moses on Sinai appears this day as an infant. The Creator of the Law fulfills the Law. He is brought into the temple and is given over to the Elder. The just Simeon receives Him, and, beholding the fulfillment of the divine promise, joyfully cries out: My eyes have seen the mystery hidden from all eternity. It has been revealed in these latter days. The Light has radiated the darkness of the unbelieving Gentiles and gives glory to the newly chosen Israel. Therefore, let Your servant depart from the bonds of this flesh to the wondrous unending life that knows no age. And we pray You to grant great mercy to the world.

He, Who once gave the Law to Moses on Sinai, today submits Himself to the prescriptions of the Law. In His compassion He has become like us for our sakes. Now the pure God, as a holy infant having opened a pure womb, is being offered as God to Himself. He is freeing us from the curse of the Law and granting light to our souls.

The Creator of heaven and earth is carried today in the arms of the Elder Simeon. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, he cried out: Now I am set free, for I have beheld my Savior.

Verse: A light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people, Israel.

Mary, the Mother of God, carried in her arms* the Lord Who rides the chariot of the Cherubim and is praised with the hymns of the Seraphim.* He was incarnate of her without human seed;* He is the Lawgiver Who fulfills the precepts of the Law.* She handed him over into the arms of the aged priest.* Holding the Life in person,* Simeon asked to be delivered of his present life, saying:* Dismiss me now, O Master, that I may tell Adam* how my eyes have seen the eternal God* Who was made man without undergoing change,* and Who brought about the salvation of the world.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): He Who rides on the Cherubim and is praised by the Seraphim* is now being brought into the holy temple according to the Law.* He is sitting in the arms of an old man as though upon a throne.* From Joseph He receives God-pleasing gifts, a pair of turtle doves,* and from the newly-chosen people of the Gentiles, an undefiled Church.* The two doves indicate that He is the head both of the Old and New Testaments.* As for Simeon, when he saw what had been revealed come to pass,* he received the child and blessed the Virgin Mother of God,* pointing out to her the sufferings that she would bear.* He asked the Lord to be released from life, saying:* Now You may dismiss me, O Lord, as You have promised;* for my eyes have seen You, the eternal Light,* the Lord and Savior of all Christian people.

He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him, he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying: / “Now, Master, you may let your servant go / in peace, according to your word, / for my eyes have seen your salvation, / which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, / a light for revelation to the Gentiles, / and glory for your people Israel.”

Exapostilarion: Inspired by the Spirit, the Elder Simeon came to the Temple.* He received in his arms the Master of the Law and cried out:* O Lord, release Your servant from the bonds of the flesh* according to Your word, in peace;* because my eyes have seen Your revelation,* Who is a light to the Gentiles and the salvation of Israel.

Aposticha

(Tone 6, Podoben – Trydneven voskres jesy): O Simeon, receive with your hands the Creator of all things.* O venerable Elder, in your arms receive Christ* to Whom the Virgin gave birth without seed.* He is a joy for all the human race.

Multitudes of angels tremble before Him* Who is God and Creator of the Law.* O people of the only Benefactor and Giver of the Law,* let us gather together and praise Him,* for He is the salvation of our souls.

Verse: A light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people, Israel.

Now You shall dismiss Your servant, O Lord,* according to Your word, in peace;* because my eyes have seen Your salvation* which You prepared before the face of all peoples,* a light to the revelation of the Gentiles,* and the glory of Your people, Israel.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 7): O Savior, You came down from heaven to earth as a light to the Gentiles;* You came forth from a Virgin and rested upon the arms of the just Simeon.* It was fitting that You, the Life-giver of all, reveal Yourself to Simeon,* for You, Who have great mercy, came to release him from this earthly life,* according to Your word.

MARCH 25
ANNUNCIATION OF THE MOTHER OF GOD
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 6, Podoben – Vse otlozhyvshe): Gabriel stood in your presence, O holy Virgin,* and revealed the eternal plan to you.* He greeted you and announced:* Rejoice, O earth that had not been sown!* Rejoice, O burning bush that was not consumed!* Rejoice, O unsearchable depth!* Rejoice, O bridge which leads to heaven;* O high ladder which Jacob saw!* Rejoice, O vessel of divine manna!* Rejoice, O invocation of Adam!* The Lord is with you.

The blameless Maiden said to the captain of the heavenly hosts:* You appear to me as a mortal,* and your words go beyond human thought.* You have said that God is with me,* and that He shall take up abode in my womb.* Tell me then, how am I to become a holy temple for the infinite One,* the Lord Who rides on the Cherubim?* Do not mislead me with deceit,* for I have known no pleasure and have not approached wedlock.* Therefore, how shall I give birth to a child?

The archangel then said to her:* Whenever God wills, the order of nature is overcome,* and that which is beyond human power is accomplished.* Therefore, O most pure and ever-holy One, believe my true words.* She then cried out, saying:* Let it now be done to me according to your word,* and I will give birth to the One Who is without flesh.* He will take flesh from me,* so that by the union He may raise the human race to the original dignity,* for He alone is all-powerful.

(Tone 6, Samohlasen): In the sixth month, the leader of the heavenly armies was sent to you, O holy Virgin,* to announce the word of salvation to you and say:* Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace; the Lord is with you!* You shall give birth to the Son Who was begotten of the Father before all ages.* He is the One who will save His people from their sins.

In the sixth month, the archangel Gabriel* was sent from heaven to Nazareth, a village of Galilee,* to bring the good news of joy to the Virgin.* Drawing near to her, he cried out, saying:* Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace; the Lord is with you!* Rejoice, O vessel of the infinite nature,* for your womb contains the One Whom even the heavens could not contain.* Rejoice, O holy Virgin, through whom Adam is called back to paradise,* Eve is freed from bondage, and the world filled with joy;* for in you the human race now rejoices.

The Divine Word, according to the plan of the Father,* took up abode in you by means of the flesh, O Virgin Mother of God.* He raised up our human race which had fallen because of the ancient curse.* Therefore, with the angel we faithfully call out to you:* Rejoice, O Mother of the Lord!

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): The archangel Gabriel was sent from heaven* to bring to the Virgin glad tidings of her conception.* When he came to Nazareth,* he marveled at the miracle and thought to himself:* How is it that He Whom the heavens cannot comprehend* is now being born of a virgin?* The One Who has heaven for a throne and earth for a footstool* is being enclosed within a virgin’s womb.* He, upon Whom the six-winged Seraphim and the many-eyed Cherubim cannot gaze,* wills to become incarnate of her by a single word.* The Word of God is at hand.* Then why do I stand by and not say to the Virgin:* Rejoice, O Full of Grace; the Lord is with you!* Rejoice, O pure Virgin and maiden bride!* Rejoice, O Mother of the Life!* Blessed is the fruit of your womb.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day; and following readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Ezekiel.

Thus says the Lord: And when these days are over, from the eighth day on, the priests shall offer your holocausts and peace offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, says the Lord GOD. Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, facing east; but it was closed. He said to me: This gate is to remain closed; it is not to be opened for anyone to enter by it; since the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it, it shall remain closed. Only the prince may sit down in it to eat his meal in the presence of the LORD. He must enter by the way of the vestibule of the gate, and leave by the same way. Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the facade of the temple, and when I looked I saw the glory of the LORD filling the LORD’s temple, and I fell prone (43:27-44:4).

Other readings: Genesis 28:10-17 (p. 1010); Proverbs 9:1-11 (p. 1041); Exodus 3:1-8.

Glory be: (Tone 8): Let heaven rejoice and earth exult,* because the eternal Son, co-eternal and co-ruler with the Father, generous in His love for mankind,* by the will and plan of the Father, accepted a state of lowliness* and took up His abode in a Virginal womb purified in advance by the Spirit.* O what a marvel! God – in a human being!* The Uncontainable – in a womb!* The timeless One – in time!* And still more glorious is the conception without seed,* the condescension unspeakable, the mystery beyond understanding:* For God lowers Himself, and takes upon Himself flesh* and develops like a human being.* The angel, announcing the conception to the most pure One, cried out:* Rejoice, O Full of Grace, the Lord,* Who grants great mercy, is with you!

Now and for ever: (Tone 2): Today Gabriel announces the good news to the Woman Full of Grace: Rejoice, O Virgin who has not known wedlock; do not fear the strangeness of my appearance, for I am an archangel. Formerly, the serpent was the cause of grief to Eve, but now it is great joy that I announce: You shall remain a virgin, and yet you shall give birth to the Lord.

Aposticha

(Tone 4): In the sixth month, the archangel was sent to the pure Virgin.* Telling her to rejoice, he announced the good tidings* that the Savior would be born of her.* Having accepted his greeting, she conceived the eternal God* Who ineffably deigned to become incarnate* for the salvation of our souls.

The Mother of God, upon hearing, did not understand* the message of the archangel* because he was speaking the words of glad tidings to her.* She accepted his greeting with faith* and conceived You, the eternal God.* Therefore, we joyfully sing to You:* O God, You became incarnate, without change, from her;* and You grant peace and great mercy to the world.

Verse: Sing a new song to the Lord; sing to the Lord all the earth!

Behold, the promised One now manifests Himself to us.* It is beyond comprehension that God unites Himself to the human race.* At the word of the archangel, deceit is cast out* because the Virgin receives the Joy.* The things of the earth become like heaven;* the world is freed of the original curse.* Let creation rejoice, and may voices cry out: O our Creator and Deliverer,* O Lord, glory to You!

Glory be: Now and for ever: Today is the joy of the annunciation and the feast of virginity.* The creatures of earth unite with those of heaven.* Adam is renewed and Eve is freed from her ancient sorrow.* She who is of our own substance becomes the temple of God* by the divinity of Him Who was conceived.* O what mystery, the incomprehensible quality of the condescension* and the inexpressible wealth of goodness!* An angel announces this miracle.* The virginal womb receives the Son,* and the Holy Spirit is sent down,* and the Father on high is well pleased.* Through the universal will, reconciliation is accomplished for all.* Let us, who have been saved in it and through it,* sing with Gabriel to the Virgin:* Rejoice, O Full of Grace!* For our salvation, Christ our God took nature from you and joined it to Himself.* Therefore; implore Him to save our souls.

Hirmos (Tone 4): Let no unclean hand touch the living tabernacle of God; but let the lips of the faithful sing endlessly with joy to the Mother of God the greeting of the angel: Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace; the Lord is with you!

Verse: Most holy Mother of God, save us!

You surpassed the laws of nature, O Virgin, by conceiving God in a manner beyond understanding. Although you were mortal by nature, you were not subject to the ordinary laws of motherhood. Therefore, it is fitting that you should be greeted with: Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace; the Lord is with you!

Verse: Most holy Mother of God, save us!

Daniel called you a spiritual mountain; Isaiah, the Mother of God; Gideon saw you as fleece, and David called you a sanctuary; another called you a gate. Gabriel now cries out to you: Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace; the Lord is with you!

Glory be: Now and for ever: O Mother of God, the Holy Scriptures mystically speak of you.

Gabriel brought greetings to the Virgin from heaven, saying:* You shall conceive and contain in your womb the One Whom all the universe cannot contain.* You will give birth to Him* Who proceeds from the Father before the dawn of time.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 2): That mystery which is from all eternity, is being revealed today.* The Son of God becomes the Son of Man.* He accepted the lowliest in order to give us the highest.* In times of old, Adam was deceived;* he desired to become like God and did not.* Now God becomes a man that He may make Adam God.* Let all creation be happy;* let nature dance with joy because the archangel stands in awe before the Virgin and greets her.* He brings the greeting which changes our grief into joy.* Through the mercy of Your compassion, You became incarnate;* O our God, glory to You!

It is I, I the LORD; / there is no savior but me. / It is I who foretold, I saved; / I made it known, not any strange god among you; / You are my witnesses, says the LORD. / I am God, yes, from eternity I am He; / There is none who can deliver from my hand; / who can countermand what I do?

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; and readings:

Lector: A reading from the first letter of St. John.

If anyone says, “I love God,” but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. This is the commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother. Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God, and everyone who loves the father loves [also] the one begotten by him. In this way we know that we love the children of God when we love God and obey his commandments. For the love of God is this, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world. And the victory that conquers the world is our faith. Who [indeed] is the victor over the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? (I, 4:20-5:5).

Verse: Holy apostle and evangelist John, pray to God for us!

STS. CYRIL AND METHODIUS
Teachers of the Slavs
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 2, Podoben – Kijmy pokhvalnymy): With what crowns of praise shall we crown Cyril and Methodius,* the celebrated preachers of the consubstantial Trinity.* With the light of the Gospel,* they illumined the Slav nations sitting in the darkness of ignorance and in the shadow of death?* Through them we also, like a wild olive tree,* have been grafted onto the fertile root of the true faith.* Therefore, we have received peace and great mercy from Christ.

With what hymns of praise shall we bless the blessed teachers?* Methodius, lover of the wilderness, enriched himself with the fruits of the Spirit amid silence;* and the golden-voiced Cyril possessed wisdom through a yearning for the philosophy on high.* They shamed the foolishness of the sages of the Khazars.* Because of them, Christ our God granted great mercy to us.

With what beautiful hymns shall we praise the blessed teachers?* Methodious spumed all the beautiful things of the world out of love for Christ.* He fought mightily like an angel out of love for the King of heaven.* Cyril chose wisdom for himself in community life from early youth,* and for God’s glory he doubled the talents given to him.* Through them we came to know the one God,* the ever-existing Trinity, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Glory be: (Tone 2): With what spiritual hymns shall we extol you, O blessed teachers?* You were apostles for the salvation of the Slavs.* With the light of the knowledge of God,* you labored well for their enlightenment though the door was closed to it.* By your invention of the Slavonic writing, this door was opened.* Having entered into it,* the Slavs now understand the mysteries of the Gospel of Christ* and receive peace and great mercy from Him.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; and readings.

Lector: A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy.

Think! The heavens, even the highest heavens, belong to the LORD, your God, as well as the earth and everything in it. Yet in his love for your fathers the LORD was so attached to them as to choose you, their descendants, in preference to all other peoples, as indeed he has now done. Circumcise your hearts; therefore, and be no longer stiff-necked. For the LORD, your God, is the God of gods, the LORD of lords, the great God; mighty and awesome, who has no favorites, accepts no bribes; who executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and befriends the alien, feeding and clothing him. So you too must befriend the alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt. The LORD, your God, shall you fear, and him shall you serve; hold fast to him and swear by his name. He is your glory, he, your God, who has done for you those great and terrible things which your own eyes have seen (10:14-21).

Verse: Your priests shall be clothed with holiness; Your faithful shall ring out their joy.

O toilers in the vineyard of Christ and sowers of piety,* you zealously sought and found the Slav people who were likened to the lost coin.* They received the Word like a treasury of eternal life, O God-bearing fathers,* and now you rejoice with the angels.* Pray to Christ, the Lover of mankind and Savior of our souls.

Verse: The mouth of the just utters wisdom, and his lips speak what is right.

O defenders of the Holy Trinity;* O guides of those who strayed;* O persuaders against the wicked blasphemy of the Khazars,* you put the disgrace of the non-believers to shame.* For Christ, the Lover of mankind and Savior of our souls,* you hastened to keep the Church intact and favorable to God* from the snares of the enemy.* Thus is the Church which you had taught through your God-pleasing labors and toil.

Glory be: (Tone 6): O people, piously observing the memory of our enlighteners,* let us gratefully cry out: Rejoice, O most splendrous shining lights!* You illumined the Slavs.* Rejoice, regions, with the light of the knowledge of God.* O good shepherds who gathered into one the human flock that was scattered in the ravines of unbelief.* You brought it back to Christ, the chief Shepherd.* We extol Him; and we bless you.

Canon from the Triodion and the following:

Ode 9 – Hirmos (Tone 3): Behold, O new and divine wonder! The Lord passes through the sealed virginal doors; He enters without a body, and exits clothed in the flesh, though the doors remain sealed. This miracle prefigured the Mother of God, whom we ineffably extol.

Verse: O holy equals to the apostles, Cyril and Methodius, pray to God for us!

O ever-praised fathers, as the main foundation of our faith, you, first of all, loudly proclaimed the heavenly words of the Son of Thunder, John the Theologian: – In the beginning was the Word, – and then the melodious words of the Psalmist, which the Church lovingly repeats: All you works of the Lord, praise the Lord.

Verse: O holy equals to the apostles, Cyril and Methodius, pray to God for us!

Who is able to praise you, O ever-praised Cyril and Methodius? Who is able to count your labors and struggles, which you, as apostles, have endured for the salvation of sinful people? Above of all, we extol you for having taught us to glorify God in our native tongue.

Lover of mankind, King of kings and Lord of lords,* You gave to Your beloved servant the wisdom of Solomon,* the meekness of David, and the true faith of the apostles.* Because of this, O almighty Jesus, Savior of our souls,* we glorify Your loving providence.

You were the first to willingly submit your royal purple to Christ,* O ever-remembered Constantine, acknowledging Him as God Who rules over all,* does good to all, and overcomes the power of every enemy.* For this reason, Jesus, the Lover of mankind and Savior of our souls,* strengthened your kingdom, O lover of Christ.

For Zion’s sake I will not be silent, / for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet, / Until her vindication shines forth like the dawn / and her victory like a burning torch. Nations shall behold your vindication, / and all kings your glory; / You shall be called by a new name / pronounced by the mouth of the LORD. / You shall be a glorious crown in the hand of the LORD, / a royal diadem held by your God. / No more shall men call you “Forsaken,” / or your land “Desolate,” / But you shall be called “My Delight,” / and your land “Espoused.” / For the LORD delights in you, / and makes your land his spouse. / As a young man marries a virgin, / your Builder shall marry you; / And as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride / so shall your God rejoice in you (61:10-62:5).

THE BIRTH OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 4): When John was born, the silence of Zechariah was broken.* For when the Voice appeared, it was not proper that his father remain silent.* Just as disbelief bound the tongue of the father,* so now the appearance of John frees him.* Having revealed himself, he preaches good tidings to all.* The Forerunner of Light and the Voice of the Word is born,* and he prays for the salvation of our souls.

Today the Voice of the Word frees his father’s voice* which was lost through disbelief,* and he reveals the blessed posterity of the Church* by loosing his mother’s bond of barrenness. The Lamp preceding the Light appears;* the star proclaims the coming of the Sun of justice* Who is the restoration of all and the salvation of our souls.

When the time approached for the Word of God to be born from a Virgin,* a messenger came forth from a barren womb.* He is the greatest born of woman and the greatest of the prophets.* Behold, the beginnings of God’s actions are beyond our understanding.* You were begotten eternally and conceived without seed;* you work wonders for our salvation. Glory to you!

O John, the baptizer of Christ,* you manifested Yourself to be a prophet and forerunner from the time you were in the womb.* When you saw the queen coming to her servant,* you leaped for joy in the womb of your mother,* you, the one conceived of a barren woman,* according to the promise made to the elder Zechariah.* You knew she was bearing the eternal One* Who was from the Father without a mother.* Now implore God to have mercy on our souls.

Zechariah did not believe the word of the angel* who told that Elizabeth would conceive and bear a son.* Instead he replied: How can she give birth,* for we are both advanced in years?* He was made silent by Your decree because of his disbelief.* Today he sees the promised birth,* and his silence is ended to give way to joy.* O, what a glorious marvel!* He shouts aloud: Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,* for He has turned to His people and brought them salvation. He grants great mercy to the world.

O most praiseworthy John and universal apostle, good news of Gabriel and flower of the barren woman,* noble child of the desert,* true friend of the bridegroom Christ,* pray to Him to have mercy on our souls.

Glory be: (Tone 6): Today, like a shining star,* the Lamp prepares the way for the coming of the Word of God.* Today Zechariah speaks clearly, ending the silence imposed by the angel,* for it was not right that the father of the Voice be kept silent once John was born from a barren womb.* He comes to announce with great boldness* the good news of salvation for all the world.

Now and for ever: Elizabeth carried the Forerunner of grace,* and the Virgin carried the Lord of glory.* When the mothers greeted each other, the infant leaped for joy,* for even within the womb, the servant praised the Master.* The mother of the Forerunner was amazed and sang out:* How have I deserved that the mother of my Lord has come to me?* Glory to Him who with great mercy saves a despairing people.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.

Thus says the Lord: Comfort, give comfort to my people, / says your God. / Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her / that her service is at an end, / her guilt is expiated; / Indeed, she has received from the hand of the LORD / double for all her sins. A voice cries out: / In the desert prepare the way of the LORD! / Make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God! Go up onto a high mountain, / Zion herald of glad tidings; / Cry out at the top of your voice, / Jerusalem, herald of good news! / Fear not to cry out / and say to the cities of Judah: / Here is your God! The afflicted and the needy seek water in vain, / their tongues are parched with thirst! I, the LORD, will answer them; / I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. / I will open up rivers on the bare heights, / and fountains in the broad valleys; / I will turn the desert into a marshland, / and the dry ground into springs of water. Let justice descend, O heavens, like dew from above, / like gentle rain let the skies drop it down. / Let the earth open and salvation bud forth; / let justice also spring up! / I, the LORD, have created this. Go forth from Babylon, flee from Chaldea! / With shouts of joy proclaim this, make it known; / Publish it to the ends of the earth, and say, / “The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob. / They did not thirst / when he led them through dry lands; / Water from the rock he set flowing for them; / he cleft the rock, and the waters welled forth” (40:1-3, 9; 41:17-18; 45:8; 48:20-21).

The God-named voice and lamp of the Light,* the Forerunner of the Lord,* was attested to by Christ as the foremost of the prophets.* Please remember your flock in order to preserve it intact,* and we also ask that you pray for the world.

O prophet and forerunner John,* you were the preacher of the Lamb Who is the Word of God.* You prophesied the future;* you spoke beforehand to the ends of the earth:* Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sins of the world* and grants great mercy to all.

Glory be: (Tone 5): Today Elizabeth rejoices as she gives birth* to the end of the prophets and the beginning of the apostles,* the earthly angel and the heavenly man,* the voice of the Word, the soldier and forerunner of Christ,* who leaped for joy beforehand because of the promised One* and who preached before the birth of the Sun of justice.* In his old age Zechariah is amazed,* having cast aside the muteness imposed as a punishment.* As the father of the Voice, he prophesies most splendidly:* And you, O child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High,* and you shall go before Him to prepare the way.* Therefore, O angel, prophet, apostle, and soldier,* forerunner, baptizer, preacher of penance, and guide,* as the voice of the light of the Word,* pray unceasingly for us who faithfully keep your memory.

Now and for ever: (Tone 5): O most pure Virgin,* you are the temple, the gate, the palace, and the throne of the King.* Christ, our Redeemer and Lord,* appeared through you to those who slumbered in darkness.* For He, as the Sun of righteousness,* wished to enlighten those whom He created with His own hands* according to His own image.* Therefore, O Lady, whom we always praise in song,* we beseech you to intercede with Christ for the salvation of our souls;* for, as His mother, you can approach Him with the greatest of confidence.

Verse: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and ransomed His people.

According to the promise,* John, the forerunner and the voice of the grace of the Word has appeared.* He was born today of the childless, barren woman.* Rejoice, O people, for he has come to prepare for us the way of the Savior* to Whom he bowed down and leaped for joy* while still in the womb of his mother.* He is the Lamb Who takes away the sins of the world* and grants great mercy to us.

Verse: And you, O child, shall be called prophet of the Most High.

John, who was sanctified in the womb of his mother* and received the fullness of prophecy,* is born today from a barren woman.* Clearly he announces the coming of the Lord:* Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Elizabeth said to the Virgin Mary:* How is it that the Mother of my God has come to me?* You bear the King, and I, a soldier.* You bear the Lawgiver, and I, a preacher of the law.* You bear the Word, and I, the voice who announces the kingdom of heaven.

(Tone 8, Podoben – Vozleh na persy): You are the true herald of the coming of Christ.* You have been most gloriously born, O praiseworthy John.* Being the fountainhead of the prophets and the voice of the Word, you called out:* Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.* Therefore, having prepared the way of the Lord,* you have been revealed to the ends of the earth as the forerunner of grace,* O baptizer and apostle.* Intercede with Christ our God to grant the remission of sins* to those who lovingly celebrate your holy memory.

After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she went into seclusion for five months, saying, “So has the Lord done for me at a time when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.” When the time arrived for Elizabeth to have her child she gave birth to a son. Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy toward her, and they rejoiced with her. When they came on the eighth day to circumcise the child, they were going to call him Zechariah after his father, but his mother said in reply, “No. He will be called John.” But they answered her, “There is no one among your relatives who has this name.” So they made signs, asking his father what he wished him to be called. He asked for a tablet and wrote, “John is his name,” and all were amazed. Immediately his mouth was opened, his tongue freed, and he spoke blessing God. Then fear came upon all their neighbors, and all these matters were discussed throughout the hill country of Judea. All who heard these things took them to heart saying, “What, then, will this child be?” For surely the hand of the Lord was with him. Then Zechariah his father, filled with the holy Spirit, prophesied, saying: / “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; / for he has visited and brought redemption to his people. / And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, / for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways.” / The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel.

After Psalm 50: Glory be: Now and for ever: and the verse, as on Sunday, then the following sticherion:

(Tone 8): Today the voice of the prophet Isaiah* is fulfilled in the birth of the greatest of the prophets, John;* He had said: Behold, I will prepare the way of the Lord.* He will be a soldier of the kingdom of heaven,* running before the path of our God.* By nature he was a man, yet in the present life he became an angel;* for he welcomed moderation in complete purity.* He had a human nature but fled what was according to nature* and struggled beyond the natural.* Therefore, let all the faithful imitate his virtues* and beg him to pray for the salvation of our souls.

With what beautiful hymns shall we praise Peter and Paul?* They are wings of divine knowledge,* spreading out to the far ends of the earth* and soaring aloft to heaven.* They are two heads of the Gospel of grace,* two feet of the preaching of the truth,* two rivers of wisdom and two arms of the cross,* through which the merciful Christ casts down the pride of demons.

With what spiritual songs shall we praise Peter and Paul?* They slew the godless tongues of idolaters.* They are fearful swords of the Spirit and notable ornaments of Rome,* nourishers of the whole world and the God-inspired tablets of the new covenant.* Christ, in His great mercy, has proclaimed their honor in Zion.

In this you rejoice, although now for a little while you may have to suffer through various trials, so that the genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that is perishable even though tested by fire, may prove to be for praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Although you have not seen him you love him; even though you do not see him now yet believe in him, you rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy, as you attain the goal of [your] faith, the salvation of your souls (I, 1:3-9).

O Paul, apostle and preacher of Christ and proud bearer of His cross,* you greatly desired the divine love above all things since it binds its lovers to the Beloved.* You were also called a prisoner of Christ;* you were strengthened by temptations which you considered sweeter than all nourishment.* Because you lived only for your Master,* you were made worthy of forgiveness at death.* Entreat Him to save and enlighten our souls.

(Tone 4, Podoben – Zvanyj svyshe byv): When the love of God took possession of you, venerable Anthony,* you began to look upon the enticements of the world as vain.* For this reason, you left your homeland and settled on the Holy Mountain.* There, among the fathers, your virtues have shone forth like a light.* Pray to Christ, Whom you have served already since your youth,* for the enlightenment and salvation of our souls.

When you were enflamed with the love of Christ,* you despised the world – its wisdom and passing glory – and led an ascetic life, like an angel.* For this, God counted you worthy of the glory of the angels.* Now standing with them before Christ, pray, Anthony,* for the enlightenment and salvation of our souls.

When you, Father, received into your heart the love of God,* you then entered a dark cave, as though it were a bridal chamber.* There you enriched yourself with knowledge, which is beyond all understanding:* To behold the future as though it were present, and to openly preach it to all. Pray to Christ,* to Whom you have consecrated yourself, since your youth,* for enlightenment and salvation of our souls.

Take three stichera from the common service of a venerable, (p. 1193).

Glory be: (Tone 6): Having witnessed your austere life and ascetic endeavors,* the fathers of the Holy mountain, under the inspiration of God,* sent you back to your homeland, saying:* Go, son, so that, there, the blind may learn about God.* Having returned, venerable father Anthony,* you enlightened your entire homeland and became the head of the community of ascetics,* whom you have drawn to Christ.* Beseech Christ also for us,* that He protect us from the enemies of our souls and grant us all salvation.

Blessings are for the head of the just, / but a rod for the back of the fool. / The memory of the just will be blessed, / but the name of the wicked will rot. / A wise man heeds commands, / but a prating fool will be overthrown. / “Give heed! for noble things I speak; / honesty opens my lips. / Yes, the truth my mouth recounts, / but wickedness my lips abhor. / Sincere are all the words of my mouth, / no one of them is wily or crooked; / All of them are plain to the man of intelligence, / and right to those who attain knowledge. / Receive my instruction in preference to silver, / and knowledge rather than choice gold. / [For Wisdom is better than corals, / and no choice possession can compare with her.] “I, Wisdom, dwell with experience, / and judicious knowledge I attain. / [The fear of the LORD is to hate evil;] / Pride, arrogance, the evil way, / and the perverse mouth I hate. / Mine are counsel and advice; / Mine is strength; I am understanding. / By me kings reign, / and lawgivers establish justice; / By me princes govern / and nobles; all the rulers of earth. Those who love me I also love, / and those who seek me find me. / With me are riches and honor, / enduring wealth and prosperity. / My fruit is better than gold, yes, than pure gold, / and my revenue than choice silver. / On the way of duty I walk, / along the paths of justice, / Granting wealth to those who love me, / and filling their treasuries.” (10: 6-8; 8: 6-21).

Like a lampstand shining in a dark place,* you have shone forth, O father Anthony!* And like the prophetic palm tree you flourished in the house of God,* offering yourself, in an unbloody sacrifice, as blessed fruit to the Master.* Therefore, having gathered together, we always extol you as it is fitting.

Verse: Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who finds great delight in His commandments.

Because your life resembled that of the great ascetic Anthony,* in God’s plan you were called Anthony, for, having gathered together many monks,* who observed your teachings, you led them to God.* Therefore, as a co-dweller of the monastics and righteous,* with whom you now stand before the Holy Trinity,* pray for all those who with hymns glorify your glorious departure.

Glory be: (Tone 6): By zealous prayer and great faith you became likened to the prophet Elijah.* For he drew from heaven fire to consume the sacrifices,* while you through prayers drew fire from heaven to prepare and purify the site* where you desired to build a glorious church in honor of the Lady and Mother of God.* Therefore, we extol you as a fellow-monastic of the ascetics and heir of the prophet and implore you:* Pray to Christ for the salvation of our souls.

Now and for ever: Christ the Lord, my Creator and Savior,* O most pure One, came forth from your womb* and clothed Himself in my human nature,* freeing Adam from the original curse.* Therefore, we sing unceasingly with the angels to you,* O most pure One, as to the Mother of God and Virgin:* Hail!

Verse: Venerable father Anthony, pray to God for us!

By the same way that led to the holy mountain, you, O father Anthony, arrived in the city of Kyiv, where you found it fitting to build a church in honor of our Lady, the Mother of God.

Glory be: (Tone 8): Having left your homeland, O venerable father Anthony* and having willingly undertaken a journey for the sake of the Lord,* you endured the burden of the long journey – thirst and hunger, heat and cold – for the sake of Christ.* For this, you heard His words: Good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of your Lord.* Pray, father, that we, who always glorify you with love,* may also hear these words.

Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of the whole community of Israel, and stretching forth his hands toward heaven, he said, “LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below: you keep your covenant of kindness with your servants who are faithful to you with their whole heart. You have kept the promise you made to my father David, your servant. You who spoke that promise, have this day, by your own power, brought it to fulfillment. Now, therefore, LORD, God of Israel, keep the further promise you made to my father David, your servant, saying, ‘You shall always have someone from your line to sit before me on the throne of Israel, provided only that your descendants look to their conduct so that they live in my presence, as you have lived in my presence.’ Now, LORD, God of Israel, may this promise which you made to my father David, your servant be confirmed. “Can it indeed be that God dwells among men on earth? If the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain you, how much less this temple which I have built! Look kindly on the prayer and petition of your servant, O LORD, my God, and listen to the cry of supplication which I, your servant, utter before you this day. May your eyes watch night and day over this temple, the place where you have decreed you shall be honored; may you heed the prayer which I your servant, offer in this place, Listen to the petitions of your servant and of your people Israel which they offer in this place. Listen from your heavenly dwelling and grant pardon.” (8:22-30).

Lector: A reading from the Second Book of Kings.

When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, he and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here; the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.” “As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live,” Elisha replied, “I will not leave you.” And so the two went on together. Fifty of the guild prophets followed, and when the two stopped at the Jordan, stood facing them at a distance. Elijah took his mantle, rolled up and struck the water, which divided, and both crossed over on dry ground. When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask for whatever I may do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha answered, “May I receive a double portion of your spirit.” “You have asked something that is not easy,” he replied. “Still, if you see me taken up from you, your wish will be granted; otherwise not.” As they walked on conversing, a flaming chariot and flaming horses came between them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. When Elisha saw it happen he cried out, “My father! my father! Israel’s chariots and drivers!” But when he could no longer see him Elisha gripped his own garment and tore it in two. Then he picked up Elijah’s mantle which had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. Wielding the mantle which had fallen from Elijah, he struck the water in his turn and said, “Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” When Elisha struck the water it divided and he crossed over (2:1, 6-14).

O heavenly prophet, you appeared as a shining cloud,* raining a shower of an understanding of God to all the faithful.* Like a rich wine you filled with happiness the faithful* who were present in your most divine temple.* Therefore, we entreat you, O heavenly prophet Elijah who sees God,* grant our country victory over her enemies* and great mercy to our souls.

With what spiritual hymns shall we celebrate the splendorous feast of the glorious martyrs,* who, for the sake of Christ, spurned the corruptible glory of the world?* One was pierced in the side with a spear,* while the other was slaughtered like a lamb.* Christ God worthily glorified them;* for this, they have received the gift of healing* and implore great mercy for all.

THE TRANSFIGURATION OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 4): O Lord, when You were transfigured before being crucified,* Mount Tabor was made to resemble heaven;* for a cloud was extended as a canopy,* and the Father bore witness to You.* Peter, James, and John were present there,* the same three apostles who were to be with You at the time of the betrayal of Judas,* so that, having seen You in glory,* they would not be dismayed at the time of Your suffering.* Likewise, O Lord, make us worthy to recognize You as our God* in the same sufferings You endured in Your great mercy,* and to adore You.

O Lord, as a preparation to Your crucifixion,* You led some of Your disciples to a high mountain* and became transfigured before them,* enlightening them with the light of Your glory.* In this way, You showed the reality of the resurrection You are to grant to us* in Your love for all and in Your almighty power as God.* Make us worthy of this resurrection, O God,* for You are gracious and the Lover of mankind.

Indeed, O Lord, the mountain that had been dark with smoke* today becomes honorable and holy because You stood on it.* The mystery hidden from the beginning of the world* becomes manifest in Your transfiguration* before Peter, James, and John.* They fell with their faces to the ground,* unable as they were to bear the light of Your countenance* and the splendor of Your clothing.* A further marvel was the vision of Moses and Elijah,* conversing with You on Your future,* and the voice of the Father bearing witness and saying:* This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!* He is the One Who will convey great mercy upon the world.

O Lord, when You were transfigured on a high mountain* in the presence of Your foremost disciples,* You radiated with glory,* showing how those who lead an outstanding life of virtue* will be made worthy of the glory of heaven.* Elijah and Moses, conversing with the Lord,* showed Him to be the Lord of the living and the dead,* God Who spoke through the law and the prophets,* the same to Whom the Father’s voice bore witness* out of the bright cloud, saying:* Hear Him, for it is He, Who through His cross despoiled Hades* and granted eternal life to the dead.

(Tone 2): Christ, the light that shone before the sun,* dwelt on earth in a human form.* Wishing to fulfill the divine work of salvation before His cross,* today He mystically reveals the image of the Trinity on Mount Tabor.* He took aside His three chosen disciples, Peter, James, and John;* and for a short time He concealed His incarnation.* He was transfigured before them,* manifesting the splendor of the original beauty.* By this He strengthened them in their faith;* yet He spared them from losing their life at this sight,* and so their eyes saw only as much as they could behold.

O Lord, when You transfigured Yourself on the mountain,* You also called upon Moses and Elijah, the most venerable of the prophets,* to witness to His divinity, testifying that He is indeed the reflection of the Father, the Lord of the living and the dead.* A cloud also enveloped them as a tent, and the voice of the Father bore witness on high, saying:* This is My beloved Son; hear Him!* I have begotten Him before the daystar in a virginal manner;* I have sent Him to save those, baptized in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,* those who confess in faith that the power of the divinity is one and indivisible.* O Christ our God, You love all humanity;* make us shine in the brightness of Your inaccessible glory;* and in Your supreme goodness,* make us worthy to inherit Your never-ending kingdom.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): O Christ our God, when You willed to prefigure Your resurrection,* You chose three disciples, Peter, James, and John;* and You went up with them to Mount Tabor.* At the moment of Your transfiguration, O Savior,* the mountain was flooded with light, and your disciples fell with their faces to the ground;* for they could not bear the sight of Your countenance upon which no one may gaze, O Word.* Angels attended with trembling and awe; the heavens were afraid;* and the earth shook to its very foundations* when they saw the Lord of glory come upon the earth.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; on Friday evening: But our God is in the heavens..., (p. 25); and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of Exodus.

The LORD said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and, while you are there, I will give you the stone tablets on which I have written the commandments intended for their instruction.” So Moses set out with Joshua, his aide, and went up to the mountain of God. The elders, however, had been told by him “Wait here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are staying with you. If anyone has a complaint, let him refer the matter to them.” After Moses had gone up, a cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the LORD settled upon Mount Sinai. The cloud covered it for six days, and on the seventh day he called Moses from the midst of the cloud. To the Israelites the glory of the LORD was seen as a consuming fire on the mountaintop. But Moses passed into the midst of the cloud as he went up on the mountain; and there he stayed for forty days and forty nights (24:12-18).

Other readings: Exodus 33:11-23; 34:4-6, 8; I Kings 19:3-16.

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 2): O God of goodness, Your light has sanctified the whole universe,* and You were transfigured on the high mountain,* revealing Your power to Your disciples.* You have redeemed the world from sin.* Therefore, we cry out to You:* O Lord of mercy, save our souls!

You were transfigured in glory on Mount Tabor, O Christ our God,* and You showed Your disciples the glory of Your divinity.* Now also pour out the light of Your knowledge upon us* and, in Your goodness and Your love for all of us,* guide us in the way of Your divine commandments.

(Tone 5): Come, let us ascend the mountain of the Lord* and go into the house of our God.* Let us contemplate the glory of His transfiguration,* the glory of the only-begotten Son of God the Father.* From His light, let us receive light;* and raised up by the Holy Spirit,* let us sing the praises of the consubstantial Trinity forever.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): Moses who saw God, and Elijah who was taken up in the flaming chariot,* contemplated You in the cloud, O Christ our God;* for You are the author of the law and the fulfillment of the prophets.* They were witnesses of Your transfiguration.* With them make us worthy of that same brightness,* that we may sing your praises forever. O Lord.

Aposticha

(Tone 1): He who mysteriously spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and said: I am Who am,* today manifests Himself to His disciples on Mount Tabor* and reveals through His person that human nature is reestablished in its original splendor.* As witnesses to this grace and partakers of this joy,* He raised up Moses and Elijah,* the forerunners of the glorious and saving resurrection* made possible by the cross of Christ.

Verse: The heavens are Yours, the world is Yours. You founded the earth and all it holds.

When David, the forefather of the Lord,* foresaw in spirit Your coming in the flesh,* he invited the whole creation to rejoice,* crying out prophetically:* O Savior, Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Your name,* for indeed You ascended this mountain with Your disciples.* Through Your transfiguration You returned Adam’s nature to its original splendor,* restoring its very elements to the glory and brilliance of Your divinity.* Therefore, we cry out to You:* O Creator of all, glory to You!

Verse: Tabor and Hermon shout with joy at Your name.

O Christ without a beginning,* when on the Mount of the transfiguration,* Your disciples saw the Light that was Yours* and Your unapproachable divinity,* they were rapt in amazement and completely changed.* They were enrobed in a radiant cloud,* and they heard the Father’s voice* confirming the mystery of Your incarnation;* for even after coming in the flesh,* You remained the only-begotten Son and the Savior of all.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): O Lord, today on Mount Tabor,* You have manifested the glory of Your divinity* to Your chosen disciples, Peter, James, and John;* they saw Your clothing radiant as light* and Your face more brilliant than the sun.* Unable to bear Your overwhelming radiance or look upon You, they fell to the ground and heard a voice bearing witness from heaven:* This is My beloved Son* Who came into the world to save His people.

Prokimenon: Ps 88 (Tone 4)
Tabor and Hermon* shout with joy at Your name.
Verse: The heavens are Yours; the world is Yours.

Gospel: Lk 9: 28-36.

About eight days after he said this, he took Peter, John, and James and went up the mountain to pray. While he was praying his face changed in appearance and his clothing became dazzling white. And behold, two men were conversing with him, Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of His exodus that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem. Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep, but becoming fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As they were about to part from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here; let us make three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” But he did not know what he was saying. While he was still speaking, a cloud came and cast a shadow over them, and they became frightened when they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud a voice that said, “This is My chosen Son; listen to him.” After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They fell silent and did not at that time tell anyone what they had seen.

After Psalm 50:
Glory be: (Tone 2): Today the whole world is filled with joy,* for Christ is transfigured before His disciples on Mount Tabor.

Verse: Have mercy on me, God, in Your kindness. In Your compassion, blot out my offense.

(Tone 5): Having revealed a small ray of Your divinity* to those who climbed the mountain with You, O Savior,* You made them partakers of Your boundless glory.* Therefore, they cried out in awe to You:* It is good for us to be here.* Together with them, we shall forever praise You, O Christ our Savior,* Who was transfigured for us.

Canon (Tone 4)

Hirmos 1: When Israel walked upon the deep sea as upon dry land, they saw Pharaoh, their pursuer, drowning, and they exclaimed: Let us sing a hymn of victory to God.

Hirmos 3: The weak have clothed themselves with strength, and the weapon of the mighty has become powerless; therefore, my heart is strengthened in the Lord.

O Lady, marvelous are your mysteries.* You have become the throne of the Most High,* and today you are taken from earth to heaven.* Your glory shines forth with the radiance of divine grace and surpasses every other splendor.* Rise up to the heavens, all you virgins,* together with the Mother of our King, and cry out:* Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace, the Lord is with you,* the Lord, Who because of you, bestows great mercy upon the world.

Behold, all the heavenly hosts, the dominations, thrones, and principalities,* virtues, powers, cherubim, and seraphim,* sing a hymn of glory to your dormition.* The entire human race rejoices at your glory;* and kings, together with the angels and archangels, sing out to you:* Rejoice, O Woman Full of Grace, the Lord is with you,* the Lord, Who because of you, bestows great mercy upon the world.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; Prokimenon of the day; and readings.

Lector: A reading from the First Book of Kings.

At the order of Solomon, the elders of Israel and all the leaders of the tribes, the princes in the ancestral houses of the Israelites, came to King Solomon in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord’s covenant from the City of David [which is Zion]. All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon during the festival in the month of Ethanim (the seventh month). When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark; they carried the ark of the LORD and the meeting tent with all the sacred vessels that were in the tent. (The priests and Levites carried them.) King Solomon and the entire community of Israel present for the occasion sacrificed before the ark sheep and oxen too many to number or count. The priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place beneath the wings of the cherubim in the sanctuary, the holy of the holies of the temple. The cherubim had their wings spread out over the place of the ark, sheltering the ark and its poles from above. The poles were so long that their ends could be seen from that part of the holy place adjoining the sanctuary; however, they could not be seen beyond. (They have remained there to this day.) There was nothing in the ark but the two stone tablets which Moses had put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites at their departure from the land of Egypt. When the priests left the holy place, the cloud filled the temple of the LORD so that the priests could no longer minister because of the cloud, since the LORD’s glory had filled the temple of the LORD (8: 1-11).

Other readings: Genesis 28:10-17 (p. 1010); Ezekiel 43:27 - 44:4 (p. 875); Proverbs 9:1-11 (p. 1041).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 1): Because the disciples had been both the eye-witnesses and servants of the Word,* it was also fitting that they should witness the final mystery,* the dormition of His Mother according to the flesh.* They not only saw the ascension of the Savior from earth to heaven,* but they also were witnesses of the translation of the Mother who bore Him.* They came to Zion to escort the Virgin, who surpasses the Cherubim,* as she hastened in her journey to heaven.* With them let us also bow low before the One who intercedes for our souls.

(Tone 2): She is higher than the heavens, more glorious than the Cherubim,* and more honorable than all creation.* Her outstanding purity became the dwelling place of the eternal divinity.* Today she places her all-pure soul into the hands of her Son.* With her, the universe is filled with joy,* and the grace of salvation is given to us.

(Tone 3): Come, all you ends of the earth,* let us praise the blessed passing of the Mother of God.* She delivers her sinless soul into the hands of her Son;* through her holy dormition the world is given new life.* With psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles,* the whole world celebrates in joy together with the angels and apostles.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): O people, sing to the Mother of our God;* for, on this day, she delivers her radiant soul* into the most pure hands of the One Who took flesh of her without seed.* In His presence she intercedes unceasingly* that He grant peace and great mercy to the world.

Aposticha

(Tone 4): All you peoples of the earth sing together a hymn of glory* to the pure and most holy Virgin* from whom the Word of God came to us,* receiving flesh from her in a manner beyond understanding.* Let us cry out: Blessed are you among women,* and blessed is your womb that contained Christ,* into Whose hands you committed your soul.* O pure Virgin, intercede with Christ God* that He may save our souls!

Verse: Go up, Lord, to the place of Your rest, You and the ark of Your strength.

O pure and most holy Virgin,* the choirs of angels in heaven and the assembly of people on earth* sing the praises of your glorious dormition;* for you have become the Mother of the Creator of all, Christ our God.* We beg you to intercede constantly for us;* for, next to God, we have placed our hope in you,* O most glorious and ever-virgin Mother of God.

Verse: The Lord swore an oath to David; He will not go back on His word.

With all the people of the earth,* let us sing to Christ the hymn of praise that David had sung of old.* Together with her escort of virgins,* with happiness and rejoicing, she will be led to the King;* for the fruit of David’s seed, the One through whom we have been led to God,* has been lifted up to glory by her Son and Master in a way that defies description.* Since she is the Mother of God,* we sing to her a hymn of glory and cry out:* Deliver us from all harm and guard our souls from tribulations.* We confess and proclaim that you are the Mother of God.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 4): O virgin Mother of God,* at the time you were carried up to the One born of you in a manner beyond understanding,* James and Peter were present;* James, the brother of the Lord and first bishop,* and Peter, the honorable head of the apostles and prince of theologians.* The whole college of apostles was also there,* all in one accord proclaiming things divine,* praising the astounding mystery of Christ,* and with joy, preparing your body, O most glorious One, source of Life and the temple of God.* The most holy angelic powers were rapt in wonder at the sight of this miracle,* and they said to each other:* Lift up your gates to receive the Mother of the Creator of heaven and earth.* Come, let us all sing hymns to her noble and holy body* that has contained the invisible Lord.* Therefore, we also celebrate your feast;* and, O woman worthy of all praise, we cry out:* O glorious Lady, exalt the Christian peoples* and intercede with Christ God that He may save our souls.

(Tone 3, Podoben – Krasoti divstva tvojeho): In giving birth, your conception was without seed;* in falling asleep, your body did not undergo corruption.* You have passed from one miracle to another, O Mother of God.* How did the Virgin who knew not man nourish an infant?* And how did the Mother of God know death?* Therefore, with the angels we cry out to you:* Rejoice, for you are full of grace.

After Psalm 50: Glory be: Now and for ever: and the verse, as on Sunday, then the following sticherion:

(Tone 6): O tabernacle all-pure, when the translation of your body took place, the apostles gathered around your bier with fear and trembling. They gazed upon you and were filled with awe. In tears, Peter cried out to you: O Virgin, I see you laid out as one dead, yet you gave birth to the Life of the universe. I am struck with amazement, for in you dwells the One Who shall be our joy in the life beyond. O pure Virgin, intercede unceasingly with your Son and God to save the Christian people.

Canon (Tone 1)

Hirmos 1: Your holy and noble death, O Virgin, is adorned with the splendid robe of divine glory. It brings all the faithful together in joy. Led by Miriam, with dances and timbrels they praise Your only-begotten Son, for He has been greatly glorified.

Hirmos 3: You are the Creator, Wisdom, and Power of God, O Christ; and You uphold all things by Your will. Make Your Church firm and faithful, for You alone are holy and dwell among the saints.

Hirmos 4: O Christ, the prophets foretold Your incarnation from a virgin, and that You would be the glory and light of revelation to the Gentiles. The abyss cries out in joy to You: Glory to Your power, for You alone love all people.

Hirmos 5: I will speak of Your divine and wondrous mysteries, O Christ. You have revealed Yourself as the divine Son, radiant with eternal brightness, Who took flesh from a virgin. You have risen as the sun, bestowing light to those who dwelt in the shadow of darkness.

Hirmos 6: Your three-day burial, O Lord, was prefigured by the sea monster, breathing forth fire; Jonah was the interpreter of this mystery; for coming forth from the monster safe and sound, he cried out: I will offer hymns of praise to You, O Lord.

Hirmos 7: Through the power of God’s love, the three youths overcame the anger and fire, extinguished the flames with dew, and scorned the anger of the tyrant. Inspired by God, they became as a three-stringed harp singing in the flaming furnace: Blessed are You, O most glorious God, for You are the God our Fathers.

Hirmos 8: The mighty angel of God showed the three holy youths a fire which was refreshing to them but destructive to the impious. He made the Theotokos a source of life gushing forth immortality to those who sing: Because we have been saved, we glorify the one and only Creator and praise Him above all forever.

Ode 9: The Magnificat is omitted; immediately after the intonation: Let us greatly extol the Theotokos..., the choir sings the following hirmos with the verse:

Verse: Seeing the dormition of the most pure One, the angels were filled with awe at how the Virgin went from earth to heaven.

Hirmos (Tone 1): In you, O pure Virgin, the laws of nature were overcome: in giving birth you remained a virgin, and in your death, heralded life. You remained a virgin after giving birth and remained alive after death, always saving your descendants, O Mother of God.

Verse: O Most Holy Mother of God, save us!
The heavenly choirs were astonished as they beheld their Master in Zion holding the soul of a woman in his hands. As a Son, it was fitting that He spoke to her who had given birth to Him without stain and said: Come and share the glory of your Son and God.

Verse: O Most Holy Mother of God, save us!
The assembly of apostles gathered around your body which had contained God. Beholding it with awe, they cried out with a clear voice: Save your people as you pass over to the heavenly mansions of your Son.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Accept from us, O Mother of the living God, our farewell hymn and encompass the Church with your light-bearing divine grace, and bestow upon your Christ-loving people peace, and upon us, who extol you, forgiveness and the salvation of our souls.

Verse: O my soul, extol the holy transference of the Mother of God from earth to heaven.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 4): Let everyone on earth dance for joy in spirit.* Let the heavenly ranks celebrate in honor of the sacred feast.* O Mother of God, let them cry: Rejoice, ever-blessed Theotokos and ever-Virgin.

Exapostilarion: O holy apostles of Christ,* gathered here from the ends of the universe,* carry my body to the garden of Gethsemane and place it in the tomb.* And You, my Son and my God,* receive my breath and my spirit.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 4, Podoben – Jako dobl'a): The heavens rejoice in your glorious dormition,* and the angelic hosts are filled with joy;* all the universe is exalting as they sing hymns of farewell to you,* O Mother of the Master of the universe,* O all-holy Virgin who did not know wedlock.* You have delivered the human race from the condemnation of old.

At the divine command,* the chosen apostles hastened from the ends of the universe to bury you;* and, seeing you carried from earth to heaven,* they praised you, with the words of Gabriel: Rejoice, O bearer of the entire Divinity!* Rejoice, O Virgin, for you alone brought heaven and earth together in giving birth to your Son.

You have given birth to Life,* and now by your holy dormition you have crossed the borders into eternal life.* The angels, the principalities, and the virtues, the prophets,* the apostles, and all creation form a procession,* and your Son receives your pure soul into his immaculate hands,* O Virgin Mother and bride of God.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): For your holy dormition,* O Mother of God and Mother of Life,* the clouds carried the apostles through the air.* Those who had been scattered throughout the world were brought together in a single choir;* and, burying your most pure body with respect,* they sang the words of Gabriel: Rejoice, O Full of Grace,* O unwedded Virgin; the Lord is with you!* Intercede with your Son and our God to save our souls.

After the great doxology: the troparion of the feast, (p. 1312); the litanies; and the great dismissal.

Blessing of Herbs, Flowers or Other Plants
(usually takes place after the Divine Liturgy)

Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.
Choir: Lord, have mercy.

The priest reads the prayer: O almighty, eternal God, by Your word alone You created out of nothing the heavens, earth, sea, and all things visible and invisible. You commanded that the earth give forth plants and trees for the needs of man and animal, each according to its need. In Your infinite goodness You ordained that these plants serve not only as food for the animals but also as medicine for the sick body. We beseech You, bless these different plants and fruits and bestow upon them Your blessing, and endow them with Your power, so that they may serve man and animal alike as a defense against all sickness and all that is impure.

Exclamation: For You are our God, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever.
Choir: Amen.

The priest then sprinkles the flowers and plants with holy water, saying:
These Flowers and Plants (or Herbs) are blessed and sanctified by the sprinkling of this holy water, in the name of the Father, † and of the Son, † and of the Holy Spirit. † Amen.

O Word, with what earthly hands shall we touch Your icon,* O Savior, the image of our sinless God and Lord beyond all reach;* for our sins have made us defiled and impure.* The Cherubim cover their eyes and tremble;* the Seraphim dare not gaze upon Your glory;* creation serves You in fear.* Do not condemn us even though we are unworthy, O Christ,* for we kiss Your awesome image in faith.

The divine feast of the Master takes place again today.* He comes from on high to visit us publicly through His precious icon.* He who dwells on high among the Cherubim* is now seen in the icon like unto Him.* It is drawn according to His likeness* by the most exquisite hand of the Father.* Bowing before it in faith and love, we are sanctified.

Glory be: (Tone 6): O Lord, You became incarnate as You willed and deigned to accept our lowliness.* You showed a wealth of compassion when You divinized us.* O Lover of mankind,* we, who gaze upon the icon of Your likeness, glorify You.* Grant to Your servants who despise all sins a safe entrance into Your kingdom.

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 6): While the birthday of the shameless Herod was being celebrated,* the oath made to the lustful dancer was fulfilled;* the head of the Forerunner was cut off* and offered on a platter to those at table.* What a loathsome banquet, filled with wickedness and horrible murder.* As for us, let us worthily venerate and bless the baptizer,* for he is the greatest man born of woman.

After dancing, the disciple of the all-evil Satan* requested your head as her payment, O Forerunner.* What a bloody banquet!* Would that you had not made that vow,* O sinful Herod, offspring of a lie.* Since you did make it, would that you had not carried it out;* for it would have been better to have gone back on your oath and received life* than remaining true to your oath to have cut off the head of the Forerunner.* As for us, let us worthily venerate and bless the baptizer,* for he is the greatest man born of woman.

Again Herodias has lost her self-control;* again she is disturbed.* What a cunning and deceiving dance,* and what mindless drunkenness!* The Forerunner’s head is cut off and Herod is troubled.* Therefore, O Lord, by the intercessions of your Forerunner,* grant peace to our souls.

(Tone 1): What shall we call you, O prophet?* An angel, an apostle, or martyr?* An angel, because you lived as a bodiless being.* An apostle, because you taught the nations.* A martyr, because you were beheaded for Christ.* Entreat Him to have mercy on our souls.

(Tone 4): Come, O people, let us exalt the prophet, martyr, and baptizer of the Savior.* He is an angel in the flesh.* He has condemned Herod and convicted him of unlawful adultery.* Because of the unlawful dancing, his precious head is cut off.* He is in paradise and is preaching the good news of the resurrection from the dead.* He is fittingly praying to the Lord* that our souls may be saved.

Come, O faithful, let us exalt the prophet, martyr, and baptizer of the Savior.* He fled into the desert and remained there,* nourishing himself on locusts and wild honey.* He rebuked the king who violated the law.* And he comforts our faintheartedness, saying:* Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Glory be: (Tone 5): When Herod wished to free himself from the rebuke of his sinful deeds,* he delivered your head unjustly, O Forerunner,* to a transgressing woman.* Nor did this wretched one realize that offering it on a platter was a condemnation for him.* Therefore, since you are a practical teacher of purity and a saving guide to repentance,* O Baptizer, implore Christ to deliver us from the shame of our passions.

Now and for ever: Dogmaticon (Tone 5), (p. 300); on Friday and Saturday evenings: the Dogmaticon of the tone of the week.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day; and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Malachi.

Thus says the Lord almighty: / Lo, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me; / And suddenly there will come to the temple / the LORD whom you seek, / And the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. / Yes, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts. / But who will endure the day of his coming? / And who can stand when he appears? / For he is like the refiner’s fire, / or like the fuller’s lye. / He will sit refining and purifying [silver], / and he will purify the sons of Levi, / Refining them like gold or like silver / that they may offer due sacrifice to the LORD. / Then the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem / will please the LORD, / as in the days of old, as in years gone by. / I will draw near to you for judgment, / and I will be swift to bear witness / Against the sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, / those who defraud the hired man of his wages, / Against those who defraud widows and orphans; / those who turn aside the stranger, / and those who do not fear me, says the LORD of hosts. Surely I, the LORD, do not change, / nor do you cease to be sons of Jacob. / Since the days of your fathers you have turned aside / from my statutes, and have not kept them. / Return to me, and I will return to you, / says the LORD of hosts. / Yet you say, “How must we return?” / Then all nations will call you blessed, / for you will be a delightful land, / says the LORD of hosts. Remember the law of Moses my servant, / which I enjoined upon him on Horeb, / The statutes and ordinances / for all Israel. / Lo, I will send you / Elijah, the prophet, / Before the day of the LORD comes, / the great and terrible day, / To turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, / and the hearts of the children to their fathers, / Lest I come and strike / the land with doom (3: 1-7, 12, 22-24).

Other readings: Isaiah 40:1-3, 9; 41:17-18, (p. 913); Wisdom 4:7, 16 - 5-7 (p. 1070).

Aposticha

(Tone 2): O John the baptizer and preacher of repentance,* you sanctified the earth when you were beheaded.* You made plain to believers the law of God,* abolishing disobedience to the law.* Therefore, since you stand by the throne of Christ the heavenly King,* beseech Him to have mercy on our souls.

Verse: The just will flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar of Lebanon.

O most holy John, your head was cut off for preaching the law of the Lord,* for in blameless privilege you reproached the unbelieving king* when he disobeyed the law.* Therefore, the hosts of angels wonder at you,* and the ranks of apostles and martyrs praise you.* We also honor your yearly memorial, O most noble one, glorifying the holy Trinity Who has crowned you, O blessed forerunner.

Verse: The just one is glad in the Lord and takes refuge in Him.

Born of the prophet Zechariah, he was the greatest of the prophets* and was sanctified from his mother’s womb for the service of the Lord.* Today he was beheaded by an evil king.* Both before and after his beheading,* his head was a living reproach for the maiden who danced indecently,* thus covering one sin with another.* Therefore, we call out:* O John the baptizer, having acquired favor with the Lord,* beseech Him unceasingly for the salvation of our souls.

Glory be: (Tone 8): You rebuked kings, O forerunner of the Savior,* that they might not act contrary to the law.* But the frolicking of a sinful woman won over Herod to behead you.* Therefore, your name is praised* from the place of the rising to the place of the setting of the sun.* And since you have favor with the Lord,* beseech Him unceasingly for the salvation of our souls.

Now and for ever: O Virgin, you have never known wedlock,* yet you conceived God in the flesh in a manner which words can never describe.* You thus became the Mother of God on high.* O immaculate Lady; receive the supplication of your servants* and grant us the cleansing of our sins.* Accept now our prayers and beseech God to save all of us.

Canon

Ode 9 – Hirmos (Tone 8): Heaven was struck with amazement, and the earth shook with fear as our God appeared in the flesh. Your womb has become more spacious than the heavens, O Mother of God. Therefore, the leaders of the heavenly hosts commend both angels and people to extol you.

Verse: Holy and great John, forerunner of the Lord, pray to God for us!

Prophet born of a prophet, and baptizer of the Lord, you were the voice crying in the desert: Repent! You reproached Herod for his immoral and godless actions. You also hasten to proclaim the kingdom of God to those held captive in Hades.

Verse: Holy and great John; forerunner of the Lord, pray for us!

When the voice that cried out in the desert was heard throughout Hades: Open, O gates, for the King of the universe is entering, it was then that humility rose and pride was brought low.

Glory be: Now and for ever: The human passions tremble and the devils flee in terror from the power given to you by the grace of God. Therefore, from every assault, O Forerunner of the Lord, protect your flock who always glorify you with faith.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 8): You are the mystical paradise, O Mother of God, which brought forth Christ. For He planted for us on earth the life-giving tree of the cross. For this reason, as we raise it aloft and bow before it, we extol you, O Mother of God.

O how the heart of Herod is hardened!* He scorns God by disobeying the law,* yet he pretends to keep his oath.* Not content with adultery,* he now becomes a murderer;* and yet he pretends to appear sad.* By your surpassing compassion,* O Christ our God, save our souls,* for You alone are compassionate.

Glory be: O wonder beyond all understanding!* The seal of the prophets and the earthly angel was offered as a prize for an immoral dance.* The tongue constantly speaking of God is sent beforehand* to preach Christ to those who are in Hades.* By your surpassing providence,* O Christ our God, save our souls,* for You alone are compassionate.

NATIVITY OF THE MOTHER OF GOD
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 6): Today God Who dominates the spiritual thrones of heaven* welcomes on earth the holy throne which He had prepared for Himself.* In His love for the human race,* He Who established the heavens in wisdom has fashioned a living heaven.* From a barren stem He has brought forth for us His Mother* as a branch full of life.* O God of miracles and hope of those who have no hope;* O Lord, glory to You!

This is the day of the Lord:* Rejoice, therefore, O nations!* Behold, the chamber of Light and the scroll of the living Word has come forth from the womb.* The gate that opens to the rising Sun* and is ready for the entrance of the High Priest, is here today.* She is the only one who introduced Christ, and Christ alone, into the world* for the salvation of our souls.

Indeed some famous barren women have given birth by the will of God;* but the nativity of Mary surpasses all nativities* in honor and splendor as it is worthy of the majesty of God.* For she was born in a miraculous way of a barren mother,* and she herself gave birth in the flesh to the God of all,* incarnate in her womb without human seed* against the laws of nature.* She alone is the door through which the only-begotten Son of God* has passed while leaving it sealed* as He had planned in His eternal wisdom.* Thus did He bring salvation to all.

Today the barren gates are opened,* and the Virgin, the gate of God, comes forth.* Today grace begins to bear fruit,* showing forth to the world the Mother of God* through whom earth is united to heaven* for the salvation of our souls.

Today glad tidings go forth to the whole world.* Today sweet fragrance is sent forth* by the proclamation of salvation.* Today is the end of the barrenness of our nature;* for the barren one becomes a mother, – the mother of the one who will not cease to be a virgin,* even after giving birth to the One Who by nature is Creator and God.* He it is Who took flesh by which He brought salvation to the lost;* He is Christ, the Lover of mankind,* and the Savior of our souls.

Today Anna, the barren one, gives birth to the maiden of God* Who had been chosen from all the human generations* to become the dwelling place of the Creator,* Christ our God and the King of all.* In her He fulfilled His divine plan through which our human nature was renewed,* and by which we were to be transferred from corruption to eternal life.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 1): Today is the beginning of our salvation, O people;* for behold, the Mother and Virgin who was chosen from all generations* to be the habitation of God* is born and comes forth from the barren one.* She is the flower from Jesse and possesses the rod from his root.* May our forefather Adam rejoice and be full of joy;* for behold, she who was created from the rib of Adam* declares that her daughter and descendant is blessed.* She says: My deliverance has been born to me. Through her, I will be freed from the bonds of Hades.* May David rejoice, play on his harp, and bless God;* for behold, the Virgin comes forth from the womb of the barren woman* for the salvation of our souls.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day; and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of Genesis.

Jacob departed from Beer-sheba and proceeded toward Haran. When he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun had already set, he stopped there for the night. Taking one of the stones at the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep at that spot. Then he had a dream: a stairway rested on the ground, with its top reaching to the heavens; and God’s messengers were going up and down on it. And there was the LORD standing beside him and saying: “I, the LORD, am the God of your forefather Abraham and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying. I will give to you and your descendants. These shall be as plentiful as the dust of the earth, and through them you shall spread out east and west, north and south. In you and your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing. Know that I am with you; I will protect you wherever you go, and bring you back to this land. I will never leave you until I have done what I promised you.” When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed, “Truly, the LORD is in this spot, although I did not know it!” In solemn wonder he cried out: “How awesome is this shrine! This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven!” (28:10-17).

Other readings: Ezekiel 43:27 - 44:4 (p. 875); Proverbs 9:1-11 (p. 1041).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 2): Come all you lovers of virginity and chastity,* lovingly hold aloft the boast of virginity,* the fountain of life springing up from the solid stone.* She is the bush which grows in the barren land,* the bush of the non-material fire,* who cleanses and illumines our souls.

What is the festive hymn that is heard today?* Joachim and Anne are mystically observing this day with honor, saying:* Adam and Eve, rejoice today with us!* Through their transgression of old, paradise was closed.* Now, Mary the maiden of God is being given to us as a blessed fruit.* She opens up the entrance of paradise to all of us.

The chosen one of the King of all,* the abode of God and divine dwelling of the ever-existing One,* comes forth today from the barren and glorious Anne.* It is through her that the shameless Hades is crushed,* and the first Eve is led into a faithful life.* Let us worthily cry out to her:* Blessed are you among women,* and blessed is the fruit of your womb!

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): Let us play the spiritual flute on this noteworthy feast,* because from the seed of David is born the Mother of the Life Who dispels the darkness.* She is the renewal of Adam and the answer to Eve,* the source of incorruption and the transformation of corruption.* Because of her, we have been deified and delivered from death.* We cry out to her with Gabriel:* Rejoice, O Full of Grace, the Lord is with you.* Because of you, He has granted to us great mercy.

Aposticha

Verse: Listen, O daughter, give ear to my words!

O Virgin, today you were born a most noble child* from the two just ones, Joachim and Anna,* as the angel had promised in his announcement.* To God you are a heaven, a throne, and a vessel of holiness;* to the whole world, a Herald of joy,* the cause of our life, the blessing that wiped out the curse.* You are the reason for all the blessings of God.* O maiden, whom God has chosen,* on this day of your nativity* obtain peace and great mercy for our souls.

Verse: The richest of people shall seek your favor.

Today Anna, the barren one, claps her hands for joy.* The earth is bathed in light and kings sing their happiness,* priests enjoy all blessings and the whole universe rejoices;* for the Queen and immaculate bride of the Father* comes forth from the root of Jesse.* Behold, no woman will ever again bear a child in sorrow or anxiety,* for joy has come forth in abundance and life has filled the world.* Joachim’s offerings shall no more be rejected,* for the tears of Anna have now been turned into joy.* And now Anna can say:* Rejoice with me, all you chosen ones of Israel;* for the Lord has given me the palace of His divine and living glory* to be a place of joy and happiness for the whole universe* and for the salvation of our souls.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): Come all you faithful, and let us hasten to the Virgin;* for long before her conception in the womb,* the one who was to be born of the root of Jesse* was destined to be the Mother of our God.* The one who is the treasury of virginity,* the flowering rod of Aaron, the object of the prophecies,* the child of Joachim and Anne is born today, and the world is renewed in her.* Through her birth, the Church is clothed with splendor.* O holy temple, vessel of the Godhead,* model of virgins and strength of kings,* in you the wondrous union of the two natures of Christ was realized.* We worship Him and glorify your most pure birth,* and the whole world extols you.

O cross, you are the radiant sign among the stars.* In prophecy you have revealed the sign of victory to the godly king;* and when his mother Helena found you,* she displayed you in the sight of all the world.* Today the choirs of the faithful shout aloud as they raise you on high:* Enlighten us by your brightness,* O life-giving and all-venerable cross.* Make us holy by your might; strengthen us by your exaltation,* for you are raised up against our enemies.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 2): Come all you people,* let us venerate the blessed cross of the Lord* through which eternal justice came to us.* He who deceived Adam, the first man, was conquered by a tree,* and the same who fettered the holy creation by his cunning* has been cast down into nothingness.* The venom of the serpent has been washed away,* by the divine blood of Christ.* The curse of the rightful sentence was lifted* when the just Christ was condemned unjustly.* By God’s plan, death that had come from a tree would be conquered by a tree,* and suffering would be healed by the suffering of the Lord.* Glory to the active presence of Your providence in our lives, O Christ, our King.* Through it You have brought salvation for all,* for You are gracious and the Lover of mankind.

The entrance; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day (on Friday evening: But our God is in the heavens... (p. 25); and the readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.

Thus says the Lord: / Your gates shall stand open constantly; / day and night they shall not be closed / But shall admit to you the wealth of nations, / and their kings, in the vanguard. / For the people or kingdom shall perish / that does not serve you; / those nations shall be utterly destroyed. / The glory of Lebanon shall come to you: / the cypress, the plane and the pine. / To bring beauty to my sanctuary, / and glory to the place where I set my feet. / The children of your oppressors shall come, / bowing low before you; / All those who despised you / shall prostrate at your feet. / They shall call you “City of the LORD,” / “Zion of the Holy One of Israel.” Once you were forsaken, / hated and unvisited, / Now I will make you the pride of the ages, / a joy to generation after generation. / You shall suck the milk of nations, / and be nursed at holy breasts; / You shall know that I, the LORD, am your savior, / your redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob (60: 11-16).

Other readings: Exodus 15:22-16:1 (p. 818); Proverbs 3:13-16; 8:6 (p. 1083).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 1): The prophecy of David is truly fulfilled today,* for we now bow down before your footstool* in the shadow of your wings, O God of love.* Filled with hope, we cry out:* Let the light of your face shine upon us* and raise up all the faithful Christians* by the exaltation of your precious cross,* O Christ, our God of tenderness and mercy!

The tree of life which was planted in the place of the Skull,* the tree upon which the King of the ages brought about our salvation,* is raised up in the middle of the earth today.* It sanctifies the ends of the earth,* and the Church of the Resurrection celebrates its rededication now.* The angels rejoice in heaven,* and those upon the earth exalt with joy and say with David:* Exalt the Lord our God and bow before his throne* and before his footstool, for He is holy;* it is He who grants great mercy to the world.

Jacob, the patriarch, prefigured your cross, O Christ,* when he blessed his descendants* by laying his hands on their heads in the form of a cross.* Today we exalt it and cry out, O Savior:* Grant victory to your Church over her enemies,* as You once did to your people.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 4): Moses prefigured the power of Your precious cross, O Christ,* when he conquered Amalek, his enemy, in the wilderness of Sinai.* When he stretched out his arms in the form of a cross,* the people were strengthened.* Now these images are fulfilled in us.* Today the cross is exalted, and the devils are put to flight.* Today all creation is freed from corruption.* Through the cross every gift of grace has shone upon us.* Therefore, rejoicing, we bow down before You and say:* How marvelous are Your works, O Lord, glory to You!

Verse: Extol the Lord our God and worship at His footstool; holy is He.

Joy to you, most honorable cross of the Lord.* Through you the human race has been delivered from the curse.* In your exaltation you are a sign of true joy.* O cross all-venerable, you scatter all our enemies.* You are the help of Christians, the glory of kings,* the strength of the just, and the splendor of priests.* All who sign themselves with you are freed from peril.* You are the strength under which we are tended like sheep.* The angels gather around you in awe as the source of peace.* You are the glory of Christ who grants great mercy to the world.

Verse: God is our King from time past, the giver of help through all the land.

Joy to you, precious cross of the Lord,* guide to the blind and physician to the sick,* and resurrection to the dead.* You raised us out of corruption and removed the curse.* Through you we have been made divine,* and the power of Hades has been destroyed in full.* Therefore, seeing you today lifted up by our priests,* we exalt Christ who was suspended on you;* and we bow deeply before you,* seeking forgiveness and great mercy.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): Of old, Moses prefigured Your cross* while vanquishing Amalek and obtaining victory over him.* David the psalmist called it Your footstool and directed us to adore it.* We sinners indeed venerate Your cross today, O Christ our God.* With our unworthy lips we extol You,* for You deigned to be crucified on it;* and we entreat You, O Lord:* Together with the thief, make us worthy of Your kingdom.

At the blessing of the bread: the troparion of the feast, (p. 1317).

Note: After the dismissal, as the choir is singing the kontakion of the feast, (p. 1317), the priest carries the decorated cross from the sacristy or from the table of prothesis, and places it on the altar – in place of the Gospel Book, which he places in front of the tabernacle.

All the ends of the earth* have seen the salvation of our God.
Verse: Sing a new song to the Lord, for He has worked wonders.

Gospel: Jn 12:28-36.

The Lord said: “Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.” The crowd there heard it and said it was thunder; but others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not come for my sake but for yours. Now is the time of judgment on this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself.” He said this indicating the kind of death he would die. So the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. Then how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” Jesus said to them “The light will be among you only a little while. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overcome you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of the light.”

Having beheld the resurrection of Christ.. (p. 128).

After Psalm 50: Glory be: Now and for ever: and the verse, as on Sunday, then the following sticherion:

(Tone 6): O cross of Christ, hope of Christians,* guide of all those who have gone astray,* haven of the storm-tossed and victory in warfare,* firm foundation of the inhabited earth,* healer of the sick and resurrection of the dead,* have mercy on us.

Canon (Tone 8)

Hirmos 1: After inscribing the invincible weapon of the cross upon the waters, Moses took his staff and marked a straight line before him and divided the Red Sea, thereby opening a path for Israel who walked across as though they were on dry land. Then Moses marked a second line over the waters and united them again, thereby overwhelming the chariots of pharaoh. Therefore, let us praise Christ our God, for He has been glorified.

Hirmos 3: When the rod of Aaron budded, it made known who was to be priest; it was an image of this mystery. Likewise in the Church that was formerly barren, the wood of the cross has now blossomed, endowing her with steadfastness and might.

Hirmos 4: I have received the mystery of Your law, O Lord; I have meditated upon Your works; and I have glorified Your divinity.

Hirmos 5: O Cross, triple-blessed tree on which Christ the King and Lord was crucified, it was through you that the Evil One, who tempted our first parents with the tree, was destroyed. He was ensnared by the trap set by God Who was crucified upon you in the flesh. Through this mystery, peace has been granted to our souls.

Hirmos 6: Clearly prefiguring the redeeming passion, Jonah stretched out his hands in the form of a cross when he was in the belly of the whale. When Jonah was cast forth after three days, he prefigured the glorious resurrection of Christ our God Who was crucified in the flesh and granted life to the world by His resurrection on the third day.

Hirmos 7: The evil command of the wicked tyrant bewildered the nations; he uttered threats and blasphemy hateful to God. Yet neither the raging wild beasts nor the roaring fire could frighten the three youths. They stood together in the fire, refreshed by the wind as though it were dew, and they sang: You are praised and blessed above all, O God of our fathers.

Hirmos 8: O you children, equal in number to the Trinity, bless the Father and Creator of all; sing the praises of the Word Who came to earth and changed the flames to dew; and exalt above all forever the most Holy Spirit Who gives life to all.

Ode 9: The Magnificat is omitted; but immediately after the intonation: Let us greatly extol the Theotokos..., the choir sings the Hirmos with the verse:

Verse: O my soul, extol the most precious Cross of the Lord.

Hirmos: O Theotokos, you are a mystical paradise, who gave birth to Christ and still remained a virgin. He planted the life-giving tree of the cross. Therefore, on this day of its exaltation, we worship Him and we extol you.

Verse: Glory to Your holy cross and crucifixion, O Lord!
Let all the trees of the forest exalt, for they are made holy by Christ Who planted them in the beginning and Who was stretched out upon the tree. On this day of its exaltation, we worship Him and extol you, O cross!

Verse: Glory to Your holy cross and crucifixion, O Lord!
The cross is marked upon the foreheads of all God’s people, and it is raised up as their sacred horn of strength. By it, all the horns of the spiritual powers of evil are crushed. Therefore, on this day of its exaltation, we worship Him and extol you, O cross!

Glory be: Now and for ever: O Lord, no longer were You able to suffer the death-bearing bitterness of the tree, so therefore You completely destroyed it by the cross. For this reason, You once sweetened the bitter waters of Mara with a dry branch, thereby prefiguring the power of the cross, which all the heavenly powers extol.

Verse: O my soul, extol, the exaltation of the life-giving Cross of the Lord.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 8): The fruit of the tree brought death to mankind; today it is destroyed by the cross; for the curse that fell upon mankind has been revoked by the fruit of the pure Mother of God, whom all the heavenly choirs extol.

Exapostilarion: The cross is the guardian of the universe;* the cross is the beauty of the Church.* It is the power of kings, and it sustains the strength of our faith.* It is the glory of the angels and the slayer of demons.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 8, Samopodoben): O, what a strange mystery!* The most holy cross, the life-giving tree,* is exalted on high today and revealed to the world.* The ends of the earth give glory, and the demons are terrified.* What a great gift is bestowed upon us mortals.* Through your cross, O Christ, save our souls,* since You alone are full of compassion.

O, what a strange mystery!* The cross which carried the Most High as a cluster of life-giving grapes* is exalted today high above the earth.* We are all drawn to God through it,* and death has been forever swallowed up.* O spotless wood, we enjoy the immortal fruit of Eden through you* as we give glory to Christ.

O, what a strange mystery!* The length and breadth of the cross is equal to the heavens,* for it sanctifies the whole world by divine grace.* By the cross savage nations are vanquished;* by the cross the authority of kings is confirmed.* O divine ladder, we go up to heaven by you* and with our hymns exalt Christ the Lord.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): Today the cross of the Lord is exalted,* and the faithful welcome it with love.* Through it they receive healing of both soul and body* and are relieved of every weakness.* Let us kiss it with joy and fear;* with joy because Christ the Lord, was crucified in His great mercy upon it;* with fear because of our unworthiness due to sin.* Through the cross, Christ our God grants salvation to the world.

Procession with the Holy Cross

At the beginning of the great doxology, the priest vested in all his priestly vestments, takes the Gospel Book from the tetrapod and places it on the altar. Then he, not the deacon, incenses the altar and the holy cross. Then taking the holy cross and placing it on his head, he processes around the altar, preceded by the deacon (with the censer) and candle-bearers.

He then proceeds through the northern doors, and stops in front of the holy doors. After the Trisagion, the deacon, or the priest (if there is no deacon) intones: Wisdom, be attentive!

The choir sings the troparion Save your people..., (p. 1317).

During the troparion, the priest places the holy cross on the tetrapod, and incenses it from all four sides; then he takes it from the tetrapod, with his two hands, and, placing it to his forehead, stands with the deacon, facing the altar; the deacon then sings the litany:

Have mercy on us, O God, according to Your great mercy, we pray You, hear us and have mercy.

The choir then sings Lord, have mercy (24x), as the priest, holding the cross, bows slowly as low as he can, and the choir, accordingly as the priest bows and rises up again slowly, lowers or raises its voice, and then at the end sings Lord, have mercy (3x). The priest now standing erect, imparts a blessing with the holy cross, then stands with the deacon on the right side of the tetrapod, and the deacon intones:

We also pray for our holy ecumenical Pontiff (name), the Pope of Rome, that the Lord God will grant him health and salvation, ever-directing him and assisting him in all he does, we pray: You, O Lord, hear us and have mercy.

The choir again sings Lord, have mercy (24x), and everything is repeated as before. Then the priest with the deacon goes behind the tetrapod, and the deacon intones:

We also pray for our blessed Patriarch (name), our most reverend Metropolitan (name), our God-loving Bishop (name), for our spiritual guides, and for all our brethren in Christ; for their health and salvation, and for the remission of their sins, let us all say.

The singing and the elevation of the cross is repeated again, as at the beginning. Then the priest goes with the deacon to the left side of the tetrapod, and the deacon intones:

We also pray for every Christian soul that is afflicted and maltreated; for their health and salvation, and for the remission of their sins, let us all say.

Again the singing and elevation is repeated as at the first time. Then the choir sings the kontakion of the feast: Willingly raised upon the cross..., (p. 1317). At the conclusion, the priest places the holy cross on the tetrapod. Then the hymn: “To Your cross, O Master, we bow in veneration; and we glorify Your holy resurrection.” – is sung three times with a profound bow each time. Then all the faithful kiss the holy cross, while the choir sings the sticheras which are on page 481.

Then the litany Let us complete our morning prayer... (see p. 143); and the great dismissal.

You appear strange to me in sight and manner, Zechariah replied,* strange in words and in report;* for I have come to ask the salvation of the people* and not to acquire a son as you proclaim.* I find you opposed to their request and fear you do not tell the truth.* For how will what you say be believed?* The limbs of Elizabeth have died,* and I am already aged.* These are sure signs that I must not believe your words.

Why do you not believe my words, Zechariah?* Why do you say I bear false tidings?* As an archangel of God I stand before you;* what I have been commanded, that I say to you!* But since you were faithless and have not believed,* you will be dumb and speechless* until you behold the divine fulfillment of my words.* When Elizabeth has borne the voice and great forerunner of the Word,* your tongue will be loosened* and you will bless the God of Israel!

Wisdom has built her house, / she has set up her seven columns; / She has dressed her meat, mixed her wine, / yes, she has spread her table. / She has sent out her maidens; she calls from the heights out over the city: / “Let whoever is simple turn in here; / to him who lacks understanding, I say, / Come eat of my food, / and drink of the wine I have mixed! / Forsake foolishness that you may live; / advance in the way of understanding. / For by me your days will be multiplied / and the years of your life increased.” He who corrects an arrogant man earns insult; / and he who reproves a wicked man incurs opprobrium. / Reprove not an arrogant man, lest he hate you; / reprove a wise man, and he will love you. / Instruct a wise man, and he becomes still wiser; / teach a just man, and he advances in learning. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD, / and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding (9:1-11).

Other readings: Genesis 28:10-17 (p. 1010); Ezekiel 43:27-44:4 (p. 875).

Look down from heaven and regard us / from your holy and glorious palace! / Where is your zealous care and your might, / your surge of pity and your mercy? / O Lord, hold not back, / for you are our father. / Were Abraham not to know us, / nor Israel to acknowledge us, / You, LORD, are our father, / our redeemer you are named forever. / Why do you let us wander, O Lord, from your ways, / and harden our hearts so that we fear you not? / Return for the sake of your servants, / the tribes of your heritage. / Why have the wicked invaded your holy place, / why have your enemies trampled your sanctuary? / Too long have we been like those you do not rule, / who do not bear your name. / Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, / with the mountains quaking before you. As when brushwood is set ablaze, / or fire makes water boil! / Thus your name would be made known to your enemies / and the nations would tremble before you, / While you wrought awesome deeds we could / not hope for, / such as they had not heard of from of old. / No ear has ever heard, no eye ever seen, / any God but you doing such deeds for those who wait for him. / Would that you might meet us doing right, / that we were mindful of you in our ways! / Behold, you are angry, and we are sinful; / Yet, O LORD, you are our father; / we are the clay and you the potter: / we are all the work of your hands. / Be not so very angry, LORD, / keep not our guilt forever in mind; / look upon us, who are all your people (63:15-19; 64: 1-4, 7-8).

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.

In the year king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high lofty throne, with the train of his garment filling the temple. Seraphim were stationed above; each of them had six wings: with two they veiled their faces, with two they veiled their feet, and with two they hovered aloft. “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts!” they cried one to the other. “All the earth is filled with his glory!” At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke. Then I said, “Woe is me, I am doomed! For I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!” Then one of the seraphim flew to me, holding an ember which he had taken with tongs from the altar. He touched my mouth with it. “See,” he said, “now that this has touched your lips, your wickedness is removed, your sin purged.” (6:1-7).

Lector: A reading from the Book of Wisdom.

But the just man, though he die early, shall be at rest. / Yes, the just man dead condemns the sinful who live, / and youth swiftly completed condemns the many years of the wicked man grown old. / For they see the death of the wise man / and do not understand what the LORD intended for him / or why he made him secure. / They see, and hold him in contempt; / but the LORD laughs them to scorn. / And they shall afterward become dishonored corpses / and an unceasing mockery among the dead. / For he shall strike them down speechless and prostrate / and rock them to their foundations; / They shall be utterly laid waste / and shall be in grief / and their memory shall perish. Fearful shall they come, at the counting up of their sins, / and their lawless deeds shall convict them to their face. Then shall the just one with great assurance confront / his oppressors who set at nought his labors. / Seeing this, they shall be shaken with dreadful fear, / and amazed at the unlooked-for salvation. / They shall say among themselves, rueful and groaning through anguish of spirit: / “This is he whom once we held as a laughingstock / and as a type of mockery, fools that we were! / His life we accounted madness, / and his death dishonored. / See how he is accounted among the sons of God; / how his lot is with the saints! / We, then, have strayed from the way of truth, / and the light of justice did not shine for us, / the sun did not rise for us. / We had our fill of the ways of mischief and of ruin; / we journeyed through impassable deserts, / but the way of the LORD we knew not (4:7, 16-20; 5:1-7).

As a priest you acted according to the divine gospel.* You sealed the divine teachings with your blood* at the hands of the flock in disunity, O great martyr Josaphat.* You dried up the river of demons,* and you went up into heaven* as a conqueror receiving the crown of victory.

O great martyr Josaphat,* the Universal Church possessed you and your priestly works.* Now you protect her in an unshakable manner from hostile wolves* as she preaches about your courage and extols you, O blessed one.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): O most pure Virgin,* you are the temple, the gate, the palace, and the throne of the King.* Christ, our Redeemer and Lord,* appeared through you to those who slumbered in darkness.* For He, as the Sun of righteousness,* wished to enlighten those whom He created with His own hands* according to His own image.* Therefore, O Lady, whom we always praise in song,* we beseech you to intercede with Christ for the salvation of our souls,* for as His mother you can approach Him with the greatest confidence.

Verse: Saint Josaphat, hieromartyr, pray to God for us!

Armed with love and hope, and fortified with faith, you destroyed the deceit and craftiness of the enemy. Now as a crowned victor you dwell in heaven, before the throne of the King of all, with the divine assembly of the angels and blessed ones.

Then the LORD said to Moses, “On the first day of the first month you shall erect the Dwelling of the meeting tent. Put the ark of the commandments in it, and screen off the ark with the veil. Bring in the table and set it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up the lamps on it. Put the golden altar of incense in front of the ark of the commandments, and hang the curtain at the entrance of the Dwelling. Put the altar of holocausts in front of the entrance of the Dwelling of the meeting tent. Place the laver between the meeting tent and the altar, and put water in it. Set up the court round about, and put the curtain at the entrance of the court. Take the anointing oil and anoint the Dwelling and everything in it, consecrating it and all its furnishings, so that it will be sacred. Anoint the altar of holocausts and all its appurtenances, consecrating it, so that it will be most sacred.” Moses did exactly as the LORD had commanded him. Then the cloud covered the meeting tent, and the glory of the LORD filled the Dwelling. Moses could not enter the meeting tent, because the cloud settled down upon it and the glory of the LORD filled the Dwelling (40:1-10, 16, 34-35).

Long life is in her right hand, / in her left are riches and honor. / For he who finds me finds life, / and wins favor from the LORD. / “To you, O men, I call; / my appeal is to the children of men. / You simple ones, gain resource, / you fools, gain sense.” / “Give heed! for noble things I speak; / honesty opens my lips.” / Sincere are all the words of my mouth, / no one of them is wily or crooked; / All of them are plain to the man of intelligence, / and right to those who attain knowledge (3:13-16; 8:35, 4-6, 8, 9).

DECEMBER 9
THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION
(Conception of St. Anna)
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 2, Podoben – Jehda ot dreva): When the wonderful Michael cast from heaven to earth the great dragon,* the ancient serpent, called the devil and Satan,* who, in his rage, swept away with his tail a third of the stars,* that is, the angels, Satan, then, in his deceitfulness,* drew after himself the entire human race,* injecting a death-dealing poison into its roots.* But it did not touch you, O most blessed daughter of Joachim,* who alone were immaculately conceived and remained immaculate.

The serpent, indeed, used a woman to deceive the human race;* but he also was overcome by a woman.* For the Creator, having shown mercy toward the work of His hands,* set an enmity between the serpent and the woman, the most blessed Virgin Mary,* between His seed and her seed, Jesus Christ.* They crushed his head, and were never harmed by him;* thus did they deliver the human race from his violence.

Myriads of saints and of God’s chosen ones struggled with Satan* and have overcome him, but not in the manner you did,* O most blessed Mother of God! For, before they overcame him, they were enslaved by him,* being born in original sin.* But you alone were conceived without sin and remained to the end without sin,* forever free from his power.

(Tone 5): The heavenly Bridegroom, Christ the Lord,* through His most pure blood took for Himself a bride – Holy Church.* He made her glorious, without defilement or blemish,* having first purified her of the stain of sin by a bath in water.* But you, most holy Virgin,* by the price of that same most precious blood* were made worthy of being conceived without sin* from the very moment of your conception,* showing yourself as the unspotted image of immaculate Holy Church.* Your heavenly Bridegroom exalts you, saying:* As the lily among the thorns, so is my beloved among women;* and again: You are all-beautiful, and there is no blemish in you.

Let us faithful sing of the immaculate Virgin Mary* with the forefather and prophet David:* Streams of the river gladden the city of God,* the holy dwelling of the Most High.* God is in its midst; it shall not be shaken;* God will help it at break of day.* For the Most High has chosen you, O Mother of God, as His dwelling place;* He has sanctified and helped you in the early dawn, causing you to be immaculate from the very first moment of conception.

In this we recognized, O all-immaculate One,* that the Most High loved you above all others,* for your enemy, Satan, never touched you.* He tried to bring you under his power from the moment of your conception,* but did not succeed.* Being that he was the prince of darkness,* you blinded him with the dazzling light of God’s grace which illumined you.* Therefore, trembling, he retreated,* not realizing, that you were the woman who was to crush his head.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 8): Having gathered together at the house of Joachim and Anna,* let us, all generations, fall down before the spiritual ark of God,* which rests in the womb of the divinely wise Anna.* Today the Lawgiver of the new grace fashioned it from incorruptible wood,* which did not know the stain of sin;* He covered it on all sides with the pure gold of sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit;* He then commanded the Cherubim to continuously shelter it with their wings.* For on it as on a chariot was to sit the God of glory,* Who wishes to deliver His people from the slavery of the spiritual Pharaoh* and bring them to the promised land of Heaven.* He will conquer the enemies that rise up against them,* for they cry out with faith:* Arise, O Lord, and let all flee who hate You!

The entrance; O Joyful Light; the prokimenon of the day; and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of Genesis.

Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the animals that the LORD God had made. The serpent asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?” The woman answered the serpent: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden; it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said, ‘You shall not eat it or even touch it, lest you die.’” But the serpent said to the woman: “You certainly will not die! No, God knows well that the moment you eat of it you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad.” The woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing to the eyes, and desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. When they heard the sound of the LORD God moving about in the garden at the breezy time of the day, the man and his wife hid themselves from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. The LORD God then called to the man and asked him, “Where are you?” He answered, “I heard you in the garden; but I was afraid, because I was naked, so I hid myself.” Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? You have eaten, then, from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat!” The man replied, “The woman whom you put here with me – she gave me fruit from the tree, and so I ate it.” The LORD God then asked the woman, “Why did you do such a thing?” The woman answered, “The serpent tricked me into it, so I ate it.” Then the LORD God said to the serpent: / “Because you have done this, you shall be banned / from all animals / and from all the wild creatures; / On your belly shall you crawl, / and dirt shall you eat / all the days of your life. / I will put enmity between you and the woman, / and between your offspring and hers; / He will strike at your head / while you strike at his heel” (3:1-15).

Other readings: – Judith 13:4-20; – Esther 7: 1-10.

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 1): It was fitting that the Queen of heaven and earth,* more honorable than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim,* be immaculately conceived and remain immaculate as the holy angels* who were created and remained immaculate;* so that, as servants of God,* they might not exalt themselves above their Queen – the Mother of God.* The Lord has willed this so.* He has arranged all things wisely.* To Him be glory and praise!

It was fitting that the Woman, the only chosen one,* be immaculately conceived together with her blessed Seed,* so that Satan might not boast, that the Mother of God was under his power.* The Lord has willed this so.* He has arranged all things wisely.* To Him be glory and praise!

It was fitting, that the second Eve, like the second Adam,* be created and remain without sin.* For with them began the renewal of the human race,* just as the fall began with the first Adam and the first Eve.* The renewal began with Christ as the first source of the spiritual life* and with Mary as the means which Christ used to bring about the renewal of man.* The Lord has willed this so.* He has arranged all things wisely.* To Him be glory and praise!

Glory be: Now and for ever: It was fitting that the Father bestow the most immaculate conception upon her,* who resembled Him in giving birth to the Son;* and that the Son bestow upon His Mother and the Holy Spirit upon His spouse* the honor of being adorned with every heavenly grace;* in a manner surpassing all other creatures,* so that she might become like her Creator.* The Holy Trinity has willed this so,* the Same Who orders all things wisely.* To the Trinity be glory and praise!

Aposticha

(Tone 1): Rejoice, O spiritual paradise,* which was planted in the East by the Lord* and was unapproachable to the ancient serpent!* In the midst of that paradise is the Tree of life – Christ,* by which all the nations are nourished and avoid eternal death.* Glory to Him Who adorned you with the flower of every virtue* and the fragrance of every grace* from the very moment of your conception.

Verse: You are all-beautiful, my beloved, and there is no blemish in you.

Rejoice, O paradise of heavenly delight!* In your midst is the spring of living water,* which flows to eternal Life – Christ!* It flows out to the four corners of the world, watering the entire earth.* Glory to Him, Who showered you with the waters of His grace* from the very moment of your conception.

Verse: As a lily among thorns, so is my beloved among women.

Rejoice, O paradise of God, virgin and holy earth,* which has never been subjected to the curse!* From her was formed the second Adam – Christ,* through Whom all generations are blessed.* Glory to Him Who took flesh from you and protected you from the curse of sin,* causing you to be completely blessed – from the very moment of your conception.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5, Podoben – Radujsia): Today, from the side of the second Adam, Jesus Christ,* Who bodily was to fall asleep on the wood of the cross* and be pierced in the side with a lance,* – the Mother of the living – the second Eve,* Mary, is immaculately formed as the model of the Bride of Christ – Holy Church.* For Christ Himself desires to be born of her in the flesh.* But today she is spiritually born of Him,* in order to renew with Him the human race.

Glory be: Now and for ever: What praises can I offer to your name,* O ship which no storm of ungodliness has ever touched in any way?* You are that immaculate earth, that place of life.* You are that ship laden with the rich treasures from the Father’s house,* which has come to our shores,* in order to bestow riches upon our fruitless and orphaned souls.

After the Polyeleos, the Exaltation is sung:

We extol you,* O most holy Virgin,* and we venerate your holy parents* and glorify your immaculate conception.

Verse: Between your offspring and hers.
Verse: He will strike at your head, while you strike at His feet.
Verse: Then shall I know that You love me, when my enemy ceases to gloat over me.

(Tone 6): Angels, archangels, principalities, dominions, powers, virtues, thrones, cherubim and seraphim, bow down and venerate with us, our Queen, immaculately conceived in the womb of blessed Anna.

Canon (Tone 1)

Hirmos 1: When Moses, the mystic, and the Israelites began to sing a canticle of praise, Miriam led the pious women in a song of victory: Let us sing to our God – our Savior!

Hirmos 3: Having made a permanent vow before the conception of the just Samuel, the holy mother Anna today rejoices and sings with us: My heart has been strengthened in the Lord.

Hirmos 4: In days of old, Habakkuk heard of Your renown, O Christ, and with fear he exclaimed: God shall come from the south, – the Holy One from Mount Paran: Glory to Your power, O Lord.

Hirmos 5: Holding an ember with tongs, the seraphim touched the mouth of Isaiah with it; and, having been purified, he learned the truth and preached it to all.

Hirmos 6: O Lover of mankind, You rescued the prophet from the sea monster; pull me also out of the depths of sin.

Hirmos 7: We faithful recognize you as a spiritual fire, O Theotokos; for just as the Most High rescued the three youths, so too, the ever-praised and glorious God of our fathers renewed the whole world in your womb.

Hirmos 8: In former times, the fiery furnace that was covered with dew prefigured an incomprehensible miracle: For the fire did not consume the three youths, but represented the divine birth of Christ from a Virgin. Therefore, let us cry out and sing: Let all creation bless the Lord, and extol Him forever.

Ode 9: The Magnificat is omitted; but immediately after the intonation: Let us greatly extol the Theotokos..., the choir sings the following verse and hirmos:

Verse: My soul, extol the Virgin Mary, who was alone with Christ immaculately conceived.

Hirmos (Tone 1): The God of Israel has shown the might in His arm; He has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted the humble. Thus, did the Orient from on high visit us and lead us onto the path of peace.

Verse: O most holy Mother of God, save us!
The Most High has cast down the proud Satan from heaven and has exalted you, O most pure One, who wished to show yourself as the most humble of all; and He has taken you out from under his power at the very moment of your conception.

Verse: O most holy Mother of God, save us!
My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior, O most pure One, for the Holy and Almighty has done a great thing by creating you alone without the stain of sin from the very moment of your conception.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Today the Lord has remembered His mercy to Abraham and to his descendants forever, by producing from his seed and immaculately preserving the most blessed Virgin Mary. For in her Offspring all nations of the earth shall be blessed.

Verse: My soul, extol the Virgin Mary, who with Christ was immaculately conceived.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 1): I contemplate a divine and marvelous mystery: heaven has become a cave; the throne of Cherubim, a Virgin; and the manger, an honorable place in which lies Christ God, the Incomprehensible. Let us praise and extol Him.

Exapostilarion: To you, O Virgin, the only good One,* do we pray: Make us, who are wicked, good;* and fervently implore Christ, the gracious One,* that we may end our life doing good.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 5): Today from the ark of the Old Testament Church* a dove – the immaculate Mary – is sent out into the world.* Her wings are of silver and her pinions are of gold* shining with the brightness of the most holy Spirit.* Desiring to be His messenger,* she brings to those who are being saved from the flood of sin* the olive branch – Christ,* so that, with His grace all mankind may be anointed for the battle* with the prince of this world.

Today the Ewe is immaculately conceived.* She is to give birth to the unblemished Lamb – Christ,* Who will offer Himself up as a sacrifice for the life of the world.* Because of His mercy,* the Creator will cover with His grace the nakedness of man,* banished from paradise.

Today a ladder is placed between heaven and earth.* It unites earth with heaven; on it the Lord is to sit.* Therefore, let Jacob awaken from sleep* and from the extraordinary vision and cry out:* Truly the Lord is in this spot, although I did not know it.* This is nothing else but an abode of God,* and that is the gateway to heaven.* It is that gateway which prefigured you,* O immaculate One.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): Let the sea of the world be aroused;* for in it is born a shell which desires to receive in the womb the divine ray* and give birth to a precious pearl from which the King,* clothed in the purple of the flesh,* has come forth to preach forgiveness to those held captive.

Having conceived in a manner beyond understanding,* the Virgin places You into the manger of the dumb animals, O eternal Word of God,* because You come to pardon the ignorance that I acquired through the envy of the serpent.* You come to be wrapped in swaddling clothes* in order to break the chains and fetters of my sins.* O only-blessed One and Lover of mankind,* I most joyfully glorify, extol, and adore You and Your coming in the flesh;* for through You I have been freed.

Glory be: (Tone 6): O cave, prepare yourself to receive the Mother* who bears Christ within her womb.* O manger, receive the Word Who destroyed the sins of all.* O shepherds, keep watch and then bear witness to the awesome wonder.* O magi, come from Persia, and bring your gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the King.* For the Lord has appeared from a virgin Mother;* yet she bowed to Him as a servant* and spoke to Him within her bosom, saying:* How were You conceived in me?* How did You grow in me, my God and Savior?

Lector: A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.

Thus says the Lord: / Be attentive to me, my people; / my folk, give ear to me. / For law shall go forth from my presence, / and my judgment, as the light of the peoples. / I will make my justice come speedily; / my salvation shall go forth / [and my arm shall judge the nations]; / In me shall the coastlands hope, / and my arm they shall await. Raise your eyes to the heavens, / and look at the earth below; / Though the heavens grow thin like smoke, / the earth wears out like a garment / and its inhabitants die like flies, / My salvation shall remain forever / and my justice shall never be dismayed. / Hear me, you who know justice, / you people who have my teaching at heart: / Fear not the reproach of men, / be not dismayed at their revilings. / They shall be like a garment eaten by moths, / like wool consumed by grubs; / But my justice shall remain forever / and my salvation, for all generations (51: 4-8).

(Tone 4, Podoben – Vse otlozhyvshe): The prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled:* Behold, a Virgin carries in her womb and is on her glorious way to give birth* to the Uncontainable, Who appears in the flesh.* Therefore, adorn yourself, O God-receiving manger, prepare, O Bethlehem,* for the King of glory chose you for His dwelling place!* Receive, O cave, the child – Christ wrapped in swaddling clothes,* Who in His goodness wishes to untie the cords of the sins of mankind.

The Master registered with His servants,* seeking to tear up the debt of sin and to inscribe in the Book of Life* all, who have been deceived by the guile of the serpent.* The Virgin carries wrapped in the flesh Him, Who carries all.* The angelic choirs, wondering at Your power,* glorify this birth along with the righteous shepherds.

The bright and spiritual cloud, filled with heavenly rain,* today rises above the earth, in order to drop dew upon it and to water it.* The spring of grace, the spiritual nightingale,* carries within the womb and gives birth to the ineffable Word.* Overcoming the winter of unbelief,* the pure and spotless palace brings to the cave the incarnate King.

Glory be: From the bosom of the Father You came forth,* O Lover of mankind, and in ineffable humility accepted supernatural poverty.* You, O Lord, deigned to dwell in a cave* and, as a child, You, the Creator and Lord, are nursed at the breasts.* Therefore, led by a star the Magi bring You gifts, as to the Lord of creation,* and the shepherds and angels wonder and cry out:* Glory to God in the highest,* Who is now coming in the form of a human being, to be born on earth.

VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 5, Podoben – Radujsia): You bear the form of Adam, yet You are all-perfect, being in the form of God.* Of Your own will You are held in human hands,* even though in Your own power You uphold all things.* The pure and undefiled Virgin spoke aloud:* How shall I wrap You in swaddling clothes like an infant?* How shall I nurse the One Who gives nourishment to the world?* How shall I not wonder in amazement at Your poverty beyond understanding?* How shall I, who am Your handmaiden, call You my Son?* I sing Your praises and I bless You,* for You grant great mercy to the world.

The undefiled Virgin beheld the eternal God as a child* Who had taken flesh from her.* She held Him in her arms and without ceasing kissed Him.* Filled with joy, she cried out:* O most high God and unseen King, how is it that I look upon You?* I cannot understand the mystery of Your immeasurable lowliness.* For the smallest of caves is a strange dwelling for You;* yet it finds room for You within itself.* You have been born without destroying my virginity,* and You have kept my womb as it was before childbirth.* Now You grant great mercy to the world.

When the Virgin saw the Magi standing before the cave,* she spoke to them in wonder:* Whom do you seek? For I see that you have come from a far country.* You have the appearance but not the thoughts of the Persians.* You have come with zeal to worship Him* Who journeyed as a stranger from on high,* and who wondrously took up abode in me in a way known only to Himself.* He grants great mercy to the world.

I hold in my arms as a child the One Who upholds all,* and I am filled with amazement.* How shall I feed You with milk, for You give food to all,* O my Son and my Creator?* I glorify Your infinite condescension whereby You save the perishing world.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): O Zion, be happy; rejoice, O Jerusalem, the city of Christ our God;* welcome the Creator Who rests in a manger in a cave.* Open your gates, Jerusalem,* and I will enter so that I may see Him Who holds all creation in His hand,* even though He lies in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes.* The angels ever praise this life-giving Lord Who is the only Savior of all.

(Tone 5, Podoben – Sobeznachalnoje Slovo): Prepare, O Bethlehem, to meet Mary, the Virgin and Mother of God, who is now coming to you.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (repeat the above).

Canon – Ode 9

Hirmos (Tone 4): Eve, through the malady of disobedience, brought about a curse; but you, O Virgin Mother of God, through the Fruit of your womb, gave the world the flower of blessing; because of this we all extol you.

Let us faithful rejoice! Let us sing and cry out with one voice: Salvation is coming to all; the Lord is on His way to be born and to save those, who devoutly celebrate His birth.

Verse: Glory be to You, our God, glory be to You!

Take up the psaltery, O holy David, and sing: O House of Ephrathah, shout for joy, for behold! He, Who was born of the Father is being gloriously born in your midst, taking flesh from the Virgin.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Like a storm and torrential rain, the Lord entered your womb, O God-bearer, Virgin-Mother. He watered the earth, which was immersed in the fog of unbelief, and dried up the sea of deceit.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 1): I contemplate a divine and marvelous mystery; heaven has become a cave; the throne of Cherubim, a Virgin; and the manger, an honorable place in which lies Christ God, the Incomprehensible. Let us praise and extol Him.

Exapostilarion: O Bethlehem, land of Judah, adorn the gates! For the Virgin and God-bearer, is coming to you, to give birth in a cave and to place in the manger my God and Lord.

FIRST HOUR

Priest: Blessed be our God, always, now and for ever and ever.
Choir: Amen. Glory be to You, our God...; the usual beginning; then: Come, let us adore..., (p. 10-11).

Psalm 43 (Messianic)

My heart overflows with noble words;* to the king I must speak the song I have made.
My tongue as nimble* as the pen of a scribe.
You are the fairest of the children of men and graciousness is poured upon Your lips:* because God has blessed You for evermore.
O mighty One, gird Your sword upon Your thigh;* in splendor and state.
Ride on in triumph for the cause of truth and goodness and right,* take aim with Your bow in your dread right hand.
Your arrows are sharp, peoples fall beneath You.* The foes of the king fall down and lose heart.
Your throne, O God, shall endure for ever;* a scepter of justice is the scepter of Your kingdom.
Your love is for justice; Your hatred for evil;* therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above other kings.
Your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia;* from ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad.
Daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor;* at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
Listen, O daughter, give ear to my words:* forget your own people and your father’s house.
So will the king desire your beauty:* He is your lord, pay homage to him.
And the people of Tyre shall come with gifts,* the richest of the people shall seek your favor.
The daughter of the king is clothed with splendor,* her robes embroidered with pearls set in gold.
She is led to the king with her maiden companions;* they are escorted amid gladness and joy;* they pass within the palace of the king.
Sons shall be yours in place of your ancestors:* you will make them princes over all the earth.
May this song make your name for ever remembered;* may the peoples praise you from age to age.

Psalms 5, (p. 150), and Psalm 45 may also be taken.

Glory be: Now and for ever:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!: Glory be to You, O God! (3x).
Lord, have mercy (3x).

Glory be: (Tone 4): At that time Mary registered..., (p. 1334).

Now and for ever: What shall we call you, O Full of Grace? A heaven, for you have borne the Sun of justice? A paradise, for you have brought forth the Flower of immortality? A virgin, for you have remained undefiled? A mother, holding in her holy arms the Son Who is the God of all? Intercede with Him for the salvation of our souls.

Then the following stichera are sung:

(Tone 8, Samohlasen): O Bethlehem prepare yourself;* O manger, adorn yourself as it behooves!* O cave, get ready to receive, for Truth has come, and the shadow has passed,* for God has come forth from a Virgin and appeared to mankind;* He has taken upon Himself our likeness and has deified our human nature.* Because of this, Adam is renewed together with Eve, and they cry out:* The mercy of God has appeared on earth to save our human race.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Thus spoke Joseph to Mary: Mary, what has happened to you?* I do not understand; and I tremble.* Therefore, I shall quickly and secretly put you away.* Mary, what is it that I behold in you?* Instead of honor, I behold shame;* instead of joy – grief; instead of praise, you have brought me disgrace.* I can no longer bear the reproach of the people.* I accepted you immaculate from the priests in the temple of the Lord;* and now what do I behold?

Having opened the holy doors, the priest (vested in the phelonion) and deacon intone:

Deacon: Let us be attentive!

Deacon: Wisdom! Let us be attentive!

Deacon: Wisdom!
Lector: A reading from the Epistle of St. Paul to the Hebrews.

Let my mouth be filled with Your praise, O Lord,* and let me sing Your glory and magnificence all the day long.

Holy God; Trinity most holy; Our Father; and the following kontakion:

O Christ, the true Light who enlightens and sanctifies everyone in the world, mark us with the light of Your countenance so that we may see the unapproachable radiance.

Choir: Amen.

THIRD HOUR

Come, let us adore....

Psalm 2 (Messianic)

Why this tumult among nations,* among peoples this useless murmuring?
They arise, the kings of the earth, princes plot against the Lord and His Anointed:* “Come, let us break their fetters, come, let us cast off their yoke.”
He Who sits in the heavens laughs;* the Lord is laughing them to scorn.
Then He will speak in His anger,* His rage will strike them with terror.
“It is I Who have set up My king* on Zion, My holy mountain.”
I will announce the decree of the Lord: The Lord said to me:* You are my Son. It is I Who have begotten You this day.
Ask and I shall bequeath You the nations,* put the ends of the earth in Your possession.
With a rod of iron you will break them,* shatter them like a potter’s jar.”
Now, O kings, understand,* take warning, rulers of the earth.
Serve the Lord with awe* and rejoice in trembling.
Pay Him your homage lest he be angry and you perish;* for suddenly His anger will blaze.
Blessed are they* who put their trust in God.

Psalms 50, (p. 161), and 66 may also be taken.

Glory be: Now and for ever:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!: Glory be to You, O God! (3x).
Lord, have mercy (3x).

Now and for ever: O Mother of God, you are the true vine laden with the Fruit of life; wherefore, we implore you, O Lady, to intercede together with the apostles and all the saints that we may obtain mercy for our souls.

Then the following stichera are sung:

(Tone 6, Samohlasen): Such is our God, Who was born of a Virgin and lived among men;* no other is to be compared to Him.* The only-begotten Son, as man, is laid in a poor manger;* the Master of all is wrapped in swaddling clothes;* and a star announces to the magi to come and worship Him,* and we sing: Holy Trinity, save our souls.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 3): Joseph, tell us:* How is it that you bring to Bethlehem a Virgin with child,* whom you received from the holy temple?* I – he replies – having ascertained from the prophets* and having received a message from the angel, was assured,* that Mary would give birth to the incomprehensible God,* Whom the magi from the East will come to worship and honor with precious gifts.* O Lord, Who for us appeared in the flesh, glory be to You.

A reading from the Book of the prophet Baruch.
Such is our God; / no other is to be compared to him: / He has traced out all the way of understanding, / and has given her to Jacob, His servant, / to Israel, His beloved son. Since then she has appeared on earth, and moved among men. She is the book of precepts of God, / the law that endures forever; / All who cling to her will live, / but those will die who forsake her. / Turn, O Jacob, and receive her: / walk by her light toward splendor. / Give not your glory to another, / your privileges to an alien race. / Blessed are we, O Israel; / for what pleases God is known to us! (3:36-4:4).

A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Galatians.
Brethren: Before faith came, we were held in custody under law, confined for the faith that was to be revealed. Consequently, the law was our disciplinarian for Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a disciplinarian. For through faith you are all children of God in Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free person, there is not male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendant, heirs according to the promise (3:23-29).

Gospel: Lk 2:1-20 (read by the priest).

The holy doors are closed, and the choir reads:

O God, give Your judgment to the king,* to a king's son Your justice,
That He may judge Your people in justice* and Your poor in right judgment.
May the mountains bring forth peace* for the people and the hills, justice.
May He defend the poor of the people* and save the children of the needy and crush the oppressor.
He shall endure like the sun* and the moon from age to age.
He shall descend like rain on the meadow,* like raindrops on the earth.
In His days justice shall flourish* and peace till the moon fails.
He shall rule from sea to sea,* from the Great River to earth’s bounds.
Before Him His enemies shall fall,* His foes lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and the sea coasts shall pay Him tribute.* The kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring Him gifts.
Before Him all kings shall fall prostrate,* all nations shall serve Him.
For He shall save the poor when they cry* and the needy who are helpless.
He will have pity on the weak* and save the lives of, the poor.
From oppression He will rescue their lives,* to Him their blood is dear.
Long may He live, may the gold of Sheba be given Him;* they shall pray for Him without ceasing and bless Him all the day.
May corn be abundant in the land to the peaks of the mountains;* may its fruit rustle like Lebanon;* in the cities may men flourish like grass on the earth.
May His name be blessed for ever and endure like the sun;* every tribe shall be blessed in Him, all nations bless His name.
Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel,* Who alone works wonders.
Ever blessed His glorious name.* Let His glory fill the earth.

Psalms 90, (p 167), and 131 may also be taken.

Glory be: Now and for ever:
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to You, O God! (3x).
Lord, have mercy (3x).

Glory be: At that time Mary registered..., (p. 1334).

Now and for ever: Since we have no one in whom to confide because of our many sins,* O Virgin Mother of God, intercede for us* with the One Who was born of you;* for a mother’s prayer is a powerful means for obtaining the Master’s favor.* You are most worthy of veneration,* so do not turn away from the pleading of us sinners;* for the One Who willed to suffer in the flesh for our sake is full of mercy,* and His power is sufficient to save us.

Then we sing the following sticherion:

(Tone 1, Samohlasen): Come, O faithful, inspired by God,* let us arise and behold the divine condescension from on high* that is manifested to us in Bethlehem.* Cleansing our minds, let us offer virtues through our lives instead of myrrh,* preparing with faith our entry into the feast of the Nativity,* storing up treasure in our souls and singing:* Glory in the highest to God in the Trinity,* Whose good pleasure is now revealed to all,* that in His love for the human race He may set Adam free from the ancestral curse.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 5): Come, O faithful, bearers of Christ,* let us behold a wonder that overtakes all minds with amazement.* In reverent worship let us sing praises with faith.* Today a maiden bearing a child comes to Bethlehem to give birth to the Lord,* and choirs of angels go before her.* Seeing these things, Joseph, her betrothed, cries out:* What is this strange mystery in you, O Virgin?* What is this strange mystery in you,* how are you to bring forth a child, without knowing man?

The rest is taken according to the rules given in the First Hour.

Prokimenon: Ps 109 (Tone 4)
From the womb, before the daystar, I have begotten You:* the Lord has sworn and He will not repent.
Verse: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand till I make Your enemies Your footstool.

A reading from the Book of the prophet Isaiah.
Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz: Ask for a sign from the LORD, your God; let it be deep as the nether world, or high as the sky! But Ahaz answered, “I will not ask! I will not tempt the LORD!” Then he said: Listen, O house of David! Is it not enough for you to weary men, must you also weary my God? Therefore the Lord himself will give you this sign: the virgin shall be with child, and bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel. / Know, O peoples, and be appalled! / Give ear, all you distant lands! / Arm, but be crushed! Arm, but be crushed! / Form a plan, and it shall be thwarted; / make a resolve, and it shall not be carried out, / for “With us is God!” (7:10-14; 8:9-10).

A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Hebrews.
At the beginning, O Lord, you established the earth, / and the heavens are the works of your hands. / They will perish, but you remain; / and they will all grow old like a garment. / You will roll them up like a cloak, / and like a garment they will be changed. / But you are the same, and your years will have no end. But to which of the angels has he ever said: / “Sit at my right hand / until I make your enemies your footstool”? / Are they not all ministering spirits sent to serve, for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation? Therefore, we must attend all the more to what we have heard, so that we may not be carried away. For if the word announced through angels proved firm, and every transgression and disobedience received its just recompense, how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? Announced originally through the Lord, it was confirmed for us by those who had heard (1:10-2:3).

Gospel: Mt 2:1-12 (read by the priest).

The holy doors are closed, and the choir reads:
Let Your bounties, O Lord, come down upon us in haste, for our need has become great indeed. Help us, O God our Savior, for the glory of Your name. Save us, O Master, and forgive our sins for the sake of Your name.

Holy God; Trinity most holy; Our Father; the kontakion: Today the Virgin give birth..., (p.1124). The rest is as in the First Hour, (p. 1124); the concluding prayer: O God, Lord of powers... is on p. 170.

NINTH HOUR

Come, let us adore....

Psalm 109 (Messianic)

The Lord’s revelation to my Master:* “Sit on my right: Your foes I will put beneath Your feet.”
The Lord will wield from Zion Your scepter of power:* rule in the midst of all Your foes.
A prince from the day of Your birth on the holy mountains;* from the womb before the dawn I begot You.
The Lord has sworn an oath; He will not change.* “You are a priest for ever, a priest like Melchizedek of old.”
The Master standing at Your right hand* will shatter kings in the day of His great wrath.
He shall drink from the stream by the wayside* and therefore He shall lift up His head.

Then Psalms 85, (p. 174), and 110 may also be taken.

Glory be: (Tone 4): At that time Mary registered..., (p. 1334).

Now and for ever: O gracious Lord, for our sake You were born of the Virgin and were crucified. You crushed Death by Your death, and, being God, brought forth the resurrection. Do not turn away from those You have made with Your own hands; but reveal instead Your love to us, O Lord of mercy. Accept as intercessor the Virgin Mother of God who gave You birth. O our Savior, save a desperate people.

Then we sing the following stichera:

(Tone 2, Samohlasen): When Joseph, overwhelmed with worry, was on his way to Bethlehem,* you, O Virgin, spoke to him, saying:* Why do you, seeing me with child, look sad and troubled,* not knowing the great mystery, which is revealed in me?* Cast away all fear and learn glorious things:* Out of love God comes to earth, receiving a body in my womb.* You shall see His birth, as He ordained;* be filled with joy and worship Him as your Creator,* Whom the angels unceasingly praise and glorify together with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): Today is born of the Virgin He, Who in His arms holds all creation.* He Who is uncontainable, as man, is wrapped in swaddling clothes;* He Who created the heavens with a word is laid in a manger;* He Who, in the desert, sent down manna from heaven like rain,* is nursed at the breasts of the Virgin.* The Bridegroom of the Church receives the magi* and the Son of the Virgin receives from them gifts.* We bow before Your birth, O Christ!* We bow before Your birth, O Christ!* We bow before Your birth, O Christ!* Now manifest to us Your divine Theophany.

The rest is taken according to the rubrics given in the First Hour.

Prokimenon: Ps 86 (Tone 4)
They shall say of Zion:* This is your Mother; a man has been born in her.

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

(Tone 2): Come, let us rejoice in the Lord;* let us proclaim the present mystery* by which the partition has been broken and the flaming sword withheld.* Now the cherubim shall let us all come to the tree of life.* As for me, I am returning to the bliss of paradise* from which I had been banished by disobedience.* Behold! The Image of the Father and His unchangeable eternity* has taken the form of a servant* without suffering He has come forth to us from an all-pure Virgin,* and yet He has remained unchanged.* He is true God as He was before,* and He has taken on Himself what He had not been,* becoming man out of His love for all.* Therefore, let us raise our voices in hymns, singing:* O God, born of the Virgin, have mercy on us.

Because the Lord Jesus was born of the holy Virgin,* all creation is enlightened.* Behold! The shepherds keep watch and the magi are adoring;* the angels are singing hymns of praise – and Herod is trembling;* for the Savior of our souls has revealed Himself in the flesh.

O Christ our God, Your kingdom is eternal,* and Your reign is from generation to generation.* You became incarnate of the Holy Spirit* and became man from the ever-virgin Mary.* Your coming, O Christ, has shed a great light upon us.* You are the Light of Light and the radiance of the Father.* You have illumined the whole creation.* Therefore, everything that breathes sings a hymn of praise to You.* You are the image of the Father’s glory.* You are the eternal God, existing before all ages,* Who shone forth from the Virgin.* O Lord our God, have mercy on us.

O Christ, what shall we offer You* for Your coming on earth in our humanity for our sake?* Every creature that has its being from You gives thanks to You:* the angels offer hymns of praise, the heavens give a star;* the magi present their gifts and the shepherds, their wonder;* the earth provides a cave and the desert, a manger.* As for us, we offer a Virgin Mother.* O God Who are from all eternity, have mercy on us.

The Persian Magi* clearly recognized the heavenly King born on earth.* Led by a bright star, they arrived at Bethlehem* bearing choice gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh;* and falling down, they adored Him;* for they saw the eternal One,* lying as a Child, in the cave.

By the will of the Father, the Word became flesh.* The Virgin gave birth to the Incarnate God.* The star proclaims and the Magi adore;* the shepherds are amazed and all creation rejoices.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 2): When Augustus became supreme ruler of the world,* the many kingdoms among the people came to an end.* Likewise, when You became incarnate of the immaculate One,* the worship of many gods had to cease.* The cities came under a universal power,* and the Gentiles believed in one supreme Divinity.* Nations were registered in the name of Caesar Augustus,* and we, the faithful, were registered in Your divine name, O incarnate One.* O Lord, great is Your mercy; glory to You!

The entrance with the Gospel Book; O Joyful Light; prokimenon of the day; on Friday the great prokimenon: What god is great as our God..., (p. 25); and readings: Genesis 1:1-13; Numbers 24:2-3, 5-9, 17-18; Micah 4:6-7; 5:1-3 (see below):

On that day, says the LORD, / I will gather the lame, / And I will assemble the outcasts, / and those whom I have afflicted. / I will make of the lame a remnant, / and of those driven far off a strong nation; / And the LORD shall be king over them on Mount Zion, / from now on forever. / But you, Bethlehem-Ephrathah, / too small to be among the clans of Judah, / From you shall come forth for me / one who is to be ruler in Israel; / Whose origin is from old, / from ancient times. / (Therefore the Lord will give them up, until the time / when she who is to give birth has borne, / And the rest of his brethren shall return / to the children of Israel.) He shall stand firm and shepherd his flock / by the strength of the LORD, / in the majestic name of the LORD, his God; / And they shall remain, for now his greatness / shall reach to the ends of the earth (4: 6-7, 5: 1-3).

The priest (deacon or the lector) intones the troparion and the verses, and the choir sings the last sentence of the troparion as a prokimenon.

But a shoot shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, / and from his roots a bud shall blossom. / The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him: / a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, / A spirit of counsel and of strength, / a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD, / and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD. / Not by appearance shall he judge, / nor by hearsay shall he decide, / But he shall judge the poor with justice, / and decide aright for the land’s afflicted. / He shall strike the ruthless with the rod of his mouth, / and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked. / Justice shall be the band around his waist, / and faithfulness a belt upon his hips. Then the wolf shall be a guest of the lamb, / and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; / The calf and the young lion shall browse together, / with a little child to guide them. / The cow and the bear shall be neighbors, / together their young shall rest; / the lion shall eat hay like the ox. / The baby shall play by the cobra’s den, / and the child lay his hand on the adder’s lair. / There shall be no harm or ruin on all my holy mountain; / for the earth shall be filled knowledge of the LORD, / as water covers the sea. On that day, / The root of Jesse, / set up as a signal for the nations, / The Gentiles shall seek out, / for his dwelling shall be glorious (11:1-10).

The priest (deacon or lector) intones the following troparion and verses, and the choir sings the last sentence of the troparion as a prokimenon.

Troparion (Tone 6): You have shone forth from the Virgin, O Christ, Sun of justice.* A star found You, whom nothing can contain, manifested in the cave.* It led the magi to adore You.* With them, we worship You,* O Giver of life; glory to You!

Choir: It led the magi to adore You. With them, we worship You, O Giver of life; glory to You!

The deacon then intones the small litany:

Again and again in peace let us pray to the Lord.
Help and save, have mercy and protect us, O God, by Your grace.

The rest is the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great.

Prokimenon: Ps 2 (Tone 1)
The Lord said to my Lord, You are my Son; this day I have begotten You.
Verse: Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for an inheritance.

A reading of the letter of St. Paul to the Hebrews.

In times past, God spoke in partial and various ways to our ancestors through the prophets; in these last days, he spoke to us through a son, whom he made heir of all things and through whom he created the universe, / who is the refulgence of His glory, / the very imprint of His being, / and who sustains all things by His mighty word. / When he had accomplished purification from sins, / he took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high, / as far superior to the angels / as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. For to which of the angels did God ever say: / “You are my son; this day I have begotten you”? / Or again: / “I will be a father to him and he shall be a son to me”? / And again, when he leads the first-born into the world, he says: / “Let all the angels of God worship him.” / Of the angels he says: / “He makes his angels winds / and his ministers a fiery flame”; / but of the Son: / “Your throne, O God, stands forever and ever; / and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom. / You loved justice and hated wickedness; / therefore God, your God, anointed you / with the oil of gladness above your companions”; / and / “At the beginning, O Lord, you established the earth, / and the heavens are the works of your hands. / They will perish, but you remain; / and they will all grow old like a garment. / You will roll them up like a cloak, / and like a garment they will be changed. / But you are the same, and your years will have no end” (1:1-12).

Alleluia: Ps 109 (Tone 5)
The Lord’s revelation to my Master: Sit at My right; Your foes I will put beneath Your feet.
Verse: The Lord will wield from Zion Your scepter of power.
Verse: Before the daystar I have begotten You.

Gospel: Lk 2:1-20.

Instead of It is truly right..., the choir sings: In you, O Woman Full of Grace....

Communion Verse: Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the heights. Alleluia (3x).

After: Blessed be the name of the Lord...; Psalm 33; and the dismissal.

Note: On Saturday or Sunday evening, if Vespers is celebrated without Divine Liturgy, we omit Holy God.... After the Gospel which the priest himself reads (the deacon reads the Gospel only at the Divine Liturgy), we take the litany Let us all say...; the Deign, Q Lord...; the litany Let us complete our evening prayer...; then immediately: Wisdom! – and the great dismissal.

GREAT COMPLINE WITH LITIYA

Great Compline is celebrated as on pp. 64-82; then we sing the following stichera of litiya; and all the rest as on Vespers with Litiya (from p. 31).

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 1): May heaven and earth rejoice prophetically this day.* May angels and people spiritually celebrate,* for God appeared in the flesh* to those groping in the darkness and resting in a shadow.* Having been born of a Virgin,* a cave and a manger received Him.* Shepherds relate a miracle;* the magi from the East bring gifts to Bethlehem,* while we, with unworthy lips, render Him angelic praise:* Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth,* for the hope of nations has arrived.* Having come, He has saved us from hostile bondage.

Today heaven and earth unite, for Christ is born.* Today God came to earth in the flesh,* and the human race was lifted up to the heavens.* Today, for the sake of all, He is seen in the flesh,* the One Who by nature is invisible.* Let us glorify Him, singing:* Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace* which Your coming has bestowed on us.* O Savior, glory to You!

Seeing the one who was made to the image and likeness of God* fall because of his transgression,* Jesus lowered the heavens and came down.* And without changing, He took up His dwelling in a virgin womb* that He might fashion anew the corrupt Adam who cried to Him:* Glory to Your epiphany, O my Deliverer and my God.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): Angels rejoice in heaven, and people exalt today,* and all creatures leap with joy* because of the birth of the Lord Savior in Bethlehem;* for all deceit of idolatry has ceased,* and Christ reigns forever.

Canon (Tone 1)

Hirmos 1: Christ is born, let us glorify Him. Christ comes down from heaven; let us go out to meet Him. Christ lives on earth, let us exalt in joy. All you faithful, sing to the Lord, for He has been glorified.

Hirmos 3: To Christ our God, Who is the only-begotten Son of the Father from before all ages, and in these latter times has become flesh of the Virgin without seed, let us cry aloud: You are our strength, glory to You, O Lord!

Hirmos 4: O Christ, You have come forth from the Virgin as the rod of the root of Jesse and the flower that blossomed from His stem. You became flesh from her who knew not wedlock, from the mountain overshadowed by the forest, O God Who are not formed from created substance. Glory to Your power, O Lord.

Hirmos 5: Since You are a God of peace and a Father of mercies, You have sent Your angel of great counsel to us to bring us peace. Thus we are directed towards the light of the knowledge of God, and at the night vigil we glorify You, O Lover of mankind.

Hirmos 6: Jonah had dwelt like a babe in the womb before the sea monster spew him forth; the Word dwelt in the womb of the Virgin, taking flesh from her. Although born from her, He kept her all-pure. Since Christ Himself was not subject to incorruptibility, He kept His Mother free from the same.

Hirmos 7: The youths who had been raised to fear God were not threatened by the fiery torments. They denounced the wicked decree of the tyrant, and standing in the midst of the flames, they sang: Blessed are You, O God our Fathers.

Hirmos 8: The dew-moistened furnace was the image of an incomprehensible wonder. It did not burn the youths entrapped there, just as the fire of the Godhead did not consume the Virgin’s womb in which He dwelt. Therefore, let us praise God, saying: Let all creation bless the Lord and exalt Him above all forever.

Ode 9: The Magnificat is omitted; instead, after the intonation: Let us greatly extol the Theotokos..., the choir sings the following hirmos with its verse.

Verse: O my soul, extol the most holy Virgin Mother of God, who is more worthy of honor than the angels of heaven.

Hirmos (Tone 1): I contemplate a divine and marvelous mystery: heaven has become a cave; the throne of cherubim, a Virgin; and the manger, an honorable place in which lies Christ God, the Incomprehensible. Let us praise and extol Him.

Verse: Glory to Your holy birth, O Lord.
Observing the unusual path of a mysterious and newly shining star which was brighter than any other heavenly light, the magi learned that Christ the King was born on earth in Bethlehem for our salvation.

Verse: Glory to Your holy birth, O Lord.
The magi asked of Herod: Where is the newborn King whose star we have seen? We have come to worship Him. The enemy of God was troubled and irrationally schemed how to kill Christ.

Glory be: Now and for ever: Herod asked the magi, who had come to Bethlehem to worship Christ with their gifts, when they had first seen the star which directed them. But the magi returned to their own country by the same star, thereby deceiving Herod, the killer of the innocents.

Verse: O my soul, extol our God, born in the flesh from the Virgin.

Katabasia: I contemplate a divine and marvelous mystery... (see above).

Exapostilarion: Our Savior, the rising Sun more brilliant than any other sun,* has visited us today from on high.* We once were in the darkness and the shadow of error,* but now we have found the truth;* for the Virgin gives birth to the Lord our God in Bethlehem.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 4): O holy ones, be happy;* O heavens, be glad; and all you mountains, sing with joy* because Christ our God today is born.* Behold, the Virgin is enthroned like the Cherubim,* holding in her arms the incarnate Word of God.* The shepherds glorify with hymns the newborn Babe;* the magi offer gifts to their Master;* and the angels sing praises and say:* O incomprehensible Lord, glory to You!

O Virgin Theotokos, you gave birth to the Savior.* You overthrew the ancient curse of Eve.* As a mother you were the benevolence of the Father.* You bore in your womb the incarnate Word of God.* We cannot understand this mystery,* but we glorify it with one faith.* We also join you in praise to say:* O ineffable Lord, glory to You!

Come, all you peoples,* let us praise the Mother of our Savior,* for she remained a virgin after childbirth.* Rejoice, O holy city of our King and God.* The Savior has chosen to live in you,* and in you He has worked out our salvation.* With Gabriel, we sing your praises;* and with the shepherds we glorify you, saying:* O Mother of God, implore Him Who became incarnate from you,* that He may save our souls.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 2): Today Christ is born of the Virgin in Bethlehem.* Today the eternal One has a beginning;* today the Word becomes incarnate.* All the heavenly powers rejoice,* and all who dwell on earth are happy.* The magi offer gifts to the Master;* the shepherds proclaim the marvel;* and we cry aloud unceasingly:* Glory to God in the highest* and on earth, peace and good will to all.

After the great doxology: the troparion of the feast, (p. 1334); the litanies; and the great dismissal.

DECEMBER 26
SYNAXIS OF THE MOTHER OF GOD AND ST. JOSEPH
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

We take six stichera: three of the Nativity, (p. 1135), and the following three of St. Joseph:

(Tone 5): The angelic choirs wondered at your life, seeing you in the body.* Shining with an angelic life, you embraced marriage and you glisten like the star of virginity;* your trade was humble, but in dignity you surpassed all the saints.* You had no silver and gold, but you were adorned with the pearls of virtue.* From heaven implore grace for us, O Betrothed Joseph,* that we may righteously preserve the vessel of chastity for the Lord,* disregard earthly things,* and enrich ourselves with heavenly things.

Who can attain to the glory of your dignity, all-worthy One? You – the father of the incarnate Son of God! You – the spouse of the spouse of the Holy Spirit!* You – the head of the Holy Family, entrusted to you by the Heavenly Father!* Because of this, the angelic choirs and the assembly of the saints in heaven, with wonderment glorify your great dignity.* With them we also on earth praise you with hymns and cry out:* Glory to Him, Who exalted you with a dignity that surpasses that of all the saints.

He Whose coming Abraham saw and rejoiced,* and Whom many of the kings and righteous wished to see,* of Him you were an eyewitness, the rearer and guardian.* He Who rested in the arms of Simeon but for a single moment,* Him you frequently carried in your arms and kissed, living with Him thirty years.* Glory to Him, Who exalted you* and with a dignity that surpasses that of all the saints.

Glory be: (Tone 8): Who will ever reach the height of your holiness, O head of the patriarchs?* For your righteousness was testified to by the marriage to the Virgin Mary.* To what height of holiness did you reach during the thirty years with such lights as Jesus and Mary,* observing their actions, listening to their words and being perfected by their prayers?* Therefore, grant that, through your holy prayers* we may have ever before us the images of Jesus and Mary,* and yours along with theirs, and advance in holiness.

Now and for ever: (Tone 6): Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth!* Today Bethlehem receives Him, Who forever is seated with the Father;* today, the angels glorify the Child born as God:* Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good will.

On Friday and Saturday evenings: the Dogmaticon of the tone of the week. The entrance; O Joyful Light; the great Prokimenon: What god is great as our God..., (p. 25); on Saturday, the prokimenon: The Lord reigns..., (p. 23); and readings:

Lector: A reading from the Book of Genesis.

This advice pleased Pharaoh and all his officials. “Could we find another like him,” Pharaoh asked his officials, “a man so endowed with the spirit of God?” So Pharaoh said to Joseph: “Since God has made all this known to you, no one can be as wise and discerning as you are. You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people shall dart at your command. Only in respect to the throne shall I outrank you. Herewith,” Pharaoh told Joseph, “I place you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.” With that, Pharaoh took off his signet-ring and put it on Joseph’s finger. He had him dressed in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. He then had him ride in the chariot of his vizier, and they shouted “Abrek!” before him. Thus was Joseph installed over the whole land of Egypt. “I, Pharaoh, proclaim,” he told Joseph, “that without your approval no one shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” (41:37-44).

Other readings: – Sirach 26:1-2, 13-17; – ibid. 1:12-18.

Stichera of Litiya

(Tone 1): Christ is truly that Lord,* Who came from the house of David and was called his son.* The angel also honored you with that title, saying:* Joseph, son of David.* But you did not receive such glory from David,* as David did from you.* Therefore, we too with the deepest respect of our hearts cry out to you:* Rejoice, O shining glory of the forefather David!

Your glory, Joseph, is your spouse, the true Mother of God,* who is more honorable than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim,* before whom bow low all the angelic hosts and the assembly of the saints.* We, too, with song cry out to you:* Rejoice, you who by the glory of your marriage* have eclipsed the glory of all the marriages of the saints.

Your glory, Joseph, is Christ, the blessed God forever,* for the Mother of God called you His father, saying to Him:* Son, why have You done this to us?* Your father and I have been looking for You with great anxiety, giving you first place.* Therefore, we, too, rejoicing with you and with all the saints, cry out to you:* Rejoice, for you share with the heavenly Father the dignity* of being the father of Christ.

Glory be: (Tone 6): Being the provider for the Judge of the living and dead* in Nazareth by the labors of your hands,* you alone, together with the chosen ones, will need not ask:* Lord, when did we see you hungry, and give you food, or thirsty, and give you drink, or naked, and clothed you?* for you did all these things for Him,* living with Him on earth.

(Tone 8, Podoben – O preslavnoho chudese): How blessed was your life with the most pure Mother of God,* O spouse equal to the angels,* You shared with her every thought, every joy, every affliction, every revelation.* You both lived together in matrimonial love, joy, and peace!* For thirty years you spent your life with her,* watching over and providing for the needs of the Son of God,* Who provided you with your heavenly needs.

Verse: Happy the husband of a good wife, twice-lengthened are his days.

What rich heavenly treasures you received* for your righteous soul from the most pure Virgin Mary!* For you, O blessed one,* were the confidant of her feelings, her joys, her enlightenments, her ecstasies* and her revelations regarding of the eternal good things.* Therefore, O God-crowned spouse,* make us partakers of your efficacious prayers.

Verse: A worthy wife brings joy to her husband, peaceful and full is his life.

How great are your virtues and gifts* of the Holy Spirit, O God-wise spouse!* You were the most pure vessel of virginity,* profound in humility, ardent in love, sublime in contemplation.* Therefore, make us worthy of these things,* O powerful intercessor, through your holy prayers.

Glory be: (Tone 4): By the many afflictions as well as joys,* your soul showed itself to be adorned like a precious robe, O eminent spouse.* In affliction you did not worry;* in joys you did not become proud,* but in the former you were long-suffering,* while in the latter you walked the path of the Lord more courageously.* Therefore, entreat the Lord that we may imitate you.

Now and for ever: You took up Your abode, O Lord, in the cave;* the manger received You, the shepherds and the magi worshiped You.* Then was the prophecy fulfilled.* The angelic powers were rapt in wonderment, singing and proclaiming:* Glory to Your coming, O only Lover of mankind.

Sessional Hymns

(Tone 3, Podoben – Khristos ot mertvykh): You were like the ancient patriarch Joseph in bodily chastity.* He was faithful to his lord, fleeing from his tempting mistress.* But knowing your Mistress – the Virgin Mother of your Lord,* you yourself were abstinent and faithfully protected her.* Therefore, implore the grace for us,* that we may also overcome the bodily passions* and preserve bodily chastity for the Lord.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 1): When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea,* all creation was illumined, recognizing its Creator.* The angelic hosts stood in amazement, seeing their Master,* Who, on earth, assumed the form of a servant.* Glory to the incarnate God!* Glory to the One, Who on earth was born!* Glory to Him, Who deigned to save the human race!

(Tone 3, Podoben – Krasoti divstva tvojeho): Your most glorious namesake, the ancient patriarch Joseph,* received from heaven the understanding and revelation of the dreams of Pharaoh and his satraps.* But to you, through the holy angel,* the Most High revealed in a dream the mystery which was hidden from the foundations of the world,* making you its faithful promoter and co-partner of the great plan.* Thus He glorified you by raising you to a high dignity in Holy Church;* therefore, pray to Him for the salvation of our souls.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 4, Podoben – Udyvysia Josyf): Why are you amazed, Mary?* Why are you awed by what has taken place in you?* – Because I gave birth in time to the eternal Son – She replied.* How can it be that I, a virgin, give birth to a son?* Who ever heard of a seedless birth?* Whenever God wishes the order of nature is changed,* as it is written. Christ was born, in order to restore the formerly fallen image.

After the Polyeleos, the Exaltation is sung:

We extol you,* O ever-praised forefather Joseph* and spouse of the most pure Mother of God,* wonderful guardian of Christ’s Church.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (p. 1149).

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 2, Podoben – Jehda ot dreva): O glorious spouse! Who can express the power of your intercession before Christ and His most blessed Mother?* To whom of the saints did the Son of God ever say: Abba, My Father?* Or who among the saints ever had the boldness to say: Beni, my son?* Or who has ever dared to say to the Mother of God: My spouse?* Or to whom has the Mother of God ever said: My spouse?* For this reason, having such confidence in them, pray that we be saved.

To whom was the Queen of heaven obedient on earth* as a wife to a husband according to Holy Scriptures:* Husband is head of his woman?* Or to whom was her Son, Jesus, being God eternally blessed,* obedient as a son to a father according to the Scriptures:* And He was subject to them?* Still more amazing is that, in past times,* God obeyed Joshua, who stopped the sun and the moon in its course according to the Scriptures:* Thus did God obey the word of man.* Therefore, O Joseph, having such confidence before them, pray that we may be saved.

According to the words of Holy Scripture: “the husband is head of his wife,”* you had authority over the Mother of God,* and more over Jesus than just merely a provider,* as if over the fruit that grows in your field,* not needing His adoption from men.* Therefore, having such confidence before them, pray that we may be saved.

With the just you will have no need to give an account to Christ at the judgment, saying:* Lord, when did I see You hungry and gave You food,* or thirsty and gave You drink, or naked and clothed You?* For you have done all these things for Him.* Therefore, having such confidence in Him,* O just Joseph, pray that we may be saved.

Glory be: (Tone 5): O Mother of the most high God,* spouse chosen by God for Joseph, the most honored among the saints!* You poured forth upon him the whole treasure of your heart,* so that he soon became a faithful mirror of your virtues.* We fervently entreat you:* pour forth upon us unworthy ones,* at least, a droplet of your virtues through his intercession* and through the intercession of your spouse, the Holy Spirit,* so that, having become like you both here on earth,* we may become like you in glory in heaven.

Now and for ever: (Tone 2): Today Christ is born of a Virgin..., (p. 1150).

DECEMBER 27
ST. STEPHEN, THE PROTOMARTYR
VESPERS

Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”

We take six stichera: three from the service of the Nativity, (p. 1143), and the following three from St. Stephen:

(Tone 4, Podoben – Jako dobl’a): Having been enlightened by the grace of the Spirit,* O Stephen, in appearance you seemed to be an angel.* Your body was bright with inner splendor,* and you revealed a radiance of soul to the onlookers.* Because of that, you also had a vision of the Light;* heaven was most gloriously opened up for you,* O first of the great martyrs.

Your sufferings became the rungs of the ladder into heaven.* When you entered, you saw the Lord standing at the right hand of the Father.* With his life-bearing right hand He extended to you a well-deserved crown.* You are standing near to Him as a brave victor* and the first of the martyrs.

Shining brightly with signs, marvels, and teachings,* you surpassed the assembly of the wicked.* You suffered death at their hands by stoning.* You prayed for their forgiveness* in accordance with the example of the Savior.* You handed over your spirit into His hands, O holy Stephen.

Glory be: (Tone 2): Shining brightly, Stephen comes forth* to the King of the universe and the Master born on earth.* He is not adorned with precious stones* but with garments crimsoned with his own blood.* O lovers of the martyrs, come forth.* Let us make a bouquet of our sacred hymns;* with heads covered with flowers, let us sing:* O Protomartyr, you illumined your soul with wisdom and grace.* Ask Christ God to grant each of us peace and great mercy.

Now and for ever: A great and glorious miracle was wrought today:* the Virgin gives birth without corrupting her virginity;* the Word is made flesh without separation from the Father;* the angels and shepherds give praise, and we exclaim with them:* Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth.

On Friday and Saturday evenings: the Dogmaticon of the tone of the week.

Sticheras of the Aposticha – of the Nativity, (p. 1144).

Glory be: (Tone 6): You showed yourself, O apostle Stephen,* to be the first of the martyrs and of the deacons.* You are the glory of the just and the pride of the faithful.* As one standing before the throne of Christ, the King of all,* in behalf of those who celebrate your memory,* pray that they be made worthy of the cleansing of sins* and of the heavenly kingdom.

Now and for ever: Angels rejoice in heaven, and people exalt today,* and all creatures leap with joy* because of the birth of the Lord Savior in Bethlehem;* for all deceit of idolatry has ceased,* and Christ reigns forever.

The troparion of St. Stephen, (p. 1336); Glory be: Now and for ever: of the Nativity, (p. 1334).

Sessional Hymns

(Tone 4, Podoben – Udyvysia Josyf): Why are you amazed, Mary?* Why are you awed by what had taken place in you?* – Because I gave birth in time to the eternal Son – She replied.* How can it be that I, a virgin, give birth to a son?* Who ever heard of a seedless birth?* Whenever God wishes, the order of nature is changed, as it is written.* Christ was born, in order to restore the formerly fallen image. (Glory be: Now and for ever: repeat the same).

(Tone 1): When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea,* all creation was illumined, recognizing its Creator.* The angelic hosts stood in amazement, seeing their Master,* Who, on earth, assumed the form of a servant.* Glory to the incarnate God!* Glory to the One Who was born on earth!* Glory to Him, Who condescended to save the human race! (Glory be: Now and for ever: repeat the same).

Psalm 50 (see p. 128).

Canon – Ode 9

Hirmos: (Tone 5): Isaiah rejoice! The Virgin conceived in the womb and gave birth to a Son Emmanuel, God and man, and His name is Orient. We extol Him, and we glorify the Virgin.

Verse: Holy protomartyr Stephen, pray to God for us!
As the first among all the saints, O Stephen, you received hymns of praise worthy of your victory, though the human mind is incapable of weaving for you a worthy crown of glory.

Verse: Holy protomartyr Stephen, pray to God for us!
How blessed, Stephen, were the words you spoke: Christ Lord, do not hold this sin against my killers, but, as God and Master, receive my spirit, as a most fragrant sacrifice.

Glory be: Now and for ever: The timeless Son of the Father through the Virgin had a beginning in this life. And Stephen, martyred for Christ, became like Him, and inherited eternal life.

Katabasia – Hirmos (Tone 1): I contemplate a divine and marvelous mystery: heaven has become a cave; the throne of Cherubim, a Virgin; and the manger, an honorable place in which lies Christ God, the Incomprehensible. Let us praise and extol Him.

Exapostilarion: Our Savior, the rising Sun more brilliant than any other sun,* has visited us today from on high.* We once were in the darkness and the shadow of error,* but now we have found the truth;* for the Virgin gives birth to the Lord our God in Bethlehem.

Stichera at the Praises

(Tone 1): Let us, the faithful, weave a martyr’s crown* for the Protomartyr with spiritual flowers!* He opened the way for martyrs, and with joy he cries out:* Behold, I see the heavens open and the Son of God,* Who is seated at the right hand of the invisible God.

(Tone 2): You showed yourself, O holy Stephen,* to be the first of the deacons and first of the martyrs.* For you became the way for the holy ones* and brought to the Lord countless martyrs;* for this reason, heaven opened to you and God appeared to you.* Pray to Him to save our souls.

You clothed yourself in holiness, blessed Stephen,* protomartyr and protodeacon,* co-partner with the angels.* Intercede and pray for us* before the sinless Savior and our Lord.

(Tone 5): O first martyr, apostle, and first deacon,* gateway of the martyrs and glory of the righteous,* praise of the apostles!* As they were stoning you, you saw heaven open and the Son of God,* Who stood at the right of the invisible Father,* with your face shining like an angel,* you joyfully prayed for those who were stoning you:* Lord, do not hold this sin against them!* Today pray also for those who lovingly glorify you* cleansing of sins and great mercy.

Glory be: Now and for ever: (Tone 6): To make the earthly heavenly, You came to earth,* received from the Virgin a body and became a visible child,* though You were the eternal Word.* You guided the Persian magi,* in order that they may worship You, O bountiful One!* Therefore, we cry out with them:* Blessed is the man born, our God, glory to You!

After the great doxology: the troparion of St. Stephen, (p. 1336). Glory be: Now and for ever: the troparion of the Nativity, (p. 1334); the litanies; and the great dismissal.
