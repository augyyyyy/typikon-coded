Entreat Him to make us also steadfast who earnestly extol you.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* As one self-condemned I ponder the multitude of my sins and the dread tribunal of the Judge, at which I must be tried. But you who gave birth to God the Judge, O Theotokos, preserve me from being condemned.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nNo sooner was the tree of Your cross planted, O Christ,* than the deception of idols was driven away and grace blossomed forth;* for the tyranny of condemnation was no more,* but the triumph of our salvation was made manifest.* For the cross is our boast, the cross is our confirmation,* the cross is our joy.\nFor our sake You were led as a sheep to sacrifice and as an innocent lamb to voluntary slaughter,* O Christ Emmanuel; and You were reckoned among iniquitous.* Come, O you nations, and sing hymns and worship the eternal Life* Who was lifted upon the cross.\nStruggling on earth, the holy martyrs endured the cold,* and gave themselves over to the fire. And as the waters received them, their cry was:* We went through fire and water, and You brought us out into refreshment.* By their supplications, O Christ God, have mercy on us.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Standing at the foot of the cross, O Jesus,* Your Mother bitterly lamented:* I cannot bear to behold nailed to the cross the One to Whom I gave birth without seed and pain.* O how I, the immaculate One, now grievously suffer* and feel faint in my heart, for today the prophecy of Simeon is fulfilled,* that a sword shall pierce my heart!* But rise, my Son, and save those who glorify You.\n\n## WEDNESDAY VESPERS\n\n**Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”**\n\n*(Podoben – Radujsia):* O disciples of the Lord,* you went over all the earth sowing the divine teaching,* taking with you the Word alone* as your only light and your only riches.* With it you confounded kings and tyrants,* and rent like a spider’s web* the arguments woven in their fury by orators and philosophers.* You called all nations to an understanding of the Maker,* and tore them from the vain service of idols.* Therefore, I entreat You, by their prayers,* to deliver me from the unreasoning passions.\n\nBy your supplications to God, O most blessed apostles,* may He deliver us from the storm of temptations,* the fearful quarrels of infamous heresies,* and the evil counsels of the devil,* the bitter wranglings and storms of mankind;* from the fire that gives no light and the eternal worm,* from the gnashing of teeth and every other torment, that through abstinence and toil we may receive the rewards of virtue, the inheritance of the Kingdom and great mercy.\n\nAs far as human nature is able,* the apostles received the brightness of the light* of the ineffable dispensation of the Word.* They showed themselves forming, with common zeal, a perfect assembly* to which the Seventy-two also belonged.* Praying to God to give the world great mercy,* they enlightened the ends of the earth that lay in destructive darkness.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nO disciples of the Savior,* you were eye-witnesses of the mysteries.* You proclaimed Him Who is invisible and without beginning by saying:* In the beginning was the Word.* You were not made before the angels,* nor were you taught by men, but by the Wisdom from on high.* Thus, having boldness, pray for our souls.\nLet us praise with one accord the apostles of the Lord;* for, arrayed in the armor of the cross, they brought to nothing the error of idolatry, *and they appeared crowned with victory.* By their prayers and those of Your servants, O God,* have mercy on us.\nWith your souls filled with unquenchable love,* you endured the most terrible sufferings without ever denying Christ;* and you laid low the impudence of the torturers.* You kept the faith unwavering and unharmed, and have gone to dwell in heaven.* Therefore, having the boldness to approach the Lord,* beg Him to grant us His great mercy.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* We call you blessed, O Virgin Theotokos; and we faithful give you glory as is right. You are an unshakable city and invincible wall, a firm intercessor and the refuge of our souls.\n\n## THURSDAY MATINS\n\n**Sessional Hymns**\n\n1. Together let us praise the apostles as eye-witnesses of the Word,* divine preachers, spiritual fishers of the nations,* for they have manifestly brought us to the understanding of Christ;* and delivering the human race from deception,* they have rendered us worthy of the kingdom.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Even before being brought to judgment, my conscience condemns me,* and I, wretch that I am, tremble at the thought of the verdict,* considering my countless sins.* Therefore, with compunction, I cry out to you,* O invincible intercessor and protectress:* Deliver me from that shame,* and save me through your prayers.\n\n2. Together let us praise the apostles,* for they preached the true doctrine of the Lord to all,* dispelling the gloom of heresies* and shining forth in the world the light of the Spirit through the teaching of grace;* and they pray for us.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Having found you to be a haven, a bulwark, a refuge, hope and protection,* and fervent help, we, the faithful flee to you,* and earnestly cry out with faith:* Have mercy, O Theotokos, upon those who place their trust in you,* and deliver us from transgressions.\n\n**Canon – Ode 9**\n\n*Hirmos:* Rejoice, O Isaiah! The Virgin has conceived in her womb and has given birth to a Son, Emmanuel. Orient is His name; and, extolling Him, we call the Virgin blessed.\n*Verse:* Holy apostles, pray to God for us!\nYou showed yourselves to be like a starry sky, shining spiritually with the splendor of divine virtues, with Christ in the center like the sun. You, O all-wise ones, renewed the ends of the earth; therefore, we extol you.\n*Verse:* Holy bishop of Christ, Nicholas, pray to God for us!\nAs a divine and holy hierarch you kept all the commandments of Christ; you became the divine preserver of the faithful, O Father Nicholas. Therefore, preserve them from all assaults and afflictions.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O all-pure one, the prophet foresaw you as the radiant lampstand, bearing Christ Who enlightened us who abide in darkness and the passions. For this reason, we bless you, O Mother of God.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nAs eye-witnesses of the mysteries of the Savior, O disciples,* you preached the invisible One Who had no beginning, saying:* In the beginning was the Word.* You were not created before the angels, nor were you taught by men,* but by the wisdom of the Most High;* therefore, having confidence, pray for our souls.\nWith one voice, let us praise the apostles of the Lord* with hymns, for, having arrayed themselves in the armor of the cross,* they abolished the deception of the demons* and were shown to be crowned victors.* Through their supplication and the prayers of the saints,* O God, have mercy on us.\nRejoicing in the midst of their torments, the saints cried out:* Our torments are wares for us to trade with the Lord;* for, instead of the wounds we bear on our bodies,* radiant vesture shall shine forth for us at the resurrection;* instead of dishonor, we shall receive crowns;* instead of fetters in prison, we shall receive paradise;* and instead of condemnation with malefactors, we shall have life with the angels.* Through their supplications, O Lord, save our souls.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* We bless you, O Mother of God,* for from you shone forth Christ, the Sun of righteousness,* Who has great mercy.\n\n## THURSDAY VESPERS\n\n**Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”**\n\nLet all the trees of the forest rejoice at the sight of Your most precious cross* that found favor by the passion of the Master.* It shines forth grace like flaming fire,* and showers gifts upon all like water.* It enlightens souls and thoughts,* washes sickness away and drives out passions.* It chases unseen devils and openly defeats hostile nations,* and bestows blessings and great mercy upon the faithful.\n\nLet us venerate the place upon which the feet of the Lord have stood,* as the prophet declared.* Let us glorify Christ Who crucified our transgressions* and destroyed the curse of the tree;* Who reconciled to the Father* those who until then had turned their thoughts away from Him.* And, venerating the nails in His hands and feet,* the revilings and the mockery,* we honor the lance and the reed, the sponge and the crown,* and all the rest to which He submitted* and by which we have been saved.\n\nLet us, who desire to follow in the steps of Christ,* the Ruler of the world,* crucify all our members in Christ,* die to the world, and take His divine cross upon our shoulders* by turning from the temptations of the flesh* and from the evil lusts that draw the world toward sin.* Let us reflect as we stand before Him* and behold Him nailed upon the cross* where, with a sigh, He commended His soul into the hands of the Father* that we might be with Him forever without separation.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nOnce, while conquering Your enemies in the days of Moses the prophet,* You manifested only the figure of the cross.* Now that we have the cross itself, we beseech Your help.* Strengthen Your Church, and give her victory* for the sake of Your great mercy, O Lover of mankind.\nThough Your cross appears to be only wood, O Christ,* yet it is arrayed as well with godlike power,* and makes itself visibly felt in the world,* spiritually bringing about the miracle of our salvation.* Venerating it, we glorify You, O Savior.\nYou were not concerned about all these earthly matters,* and you courageously braved the tortures.* You did not sin against hope,* having confidence in God’s love for mankind.* And you were heirs to the kingdom of heaven,* O most praiseworthy martyrs.* Ask for peace for the world and great mercy for our souls.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* When she saw the Lamb, her Son, lifted upon the cross,* the Virgin Mother and most blessed Maiden wept, crying: O my Son, woe is me!* How are You dying; for You are God, immortal by nature?\n\n## FRIDAY MATINS\n\n**Sessional Hymns**\n\n1. Let us, the faithful, sing hymns and glorify the Savior and our Deliverer,* Who of His own free will was crucified as He desired and willed.* He nailed to the cross the sins of mankind,* delivering the human race from deception* and granting it His kingdom.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Standing near the cross of the Lord,* the pure Mother of God, wept and cried out:* O my divine Son, my light most beloved!* How is it that You are stretched out on the cross,* Who spread out the heavens like a tent,* and brought forth from the sea springs of water with but a word?\n\n2. Of Your own free will You suffered the crucifixion,* O compassionate One, and as the almighty God* You abolished the ancient curse brought about by unlawful eating.* For this reason, we sing, O Christ Master,* Your divine and precious sufferings,* and we bow down before them,* glorifying without ceasing Your ineffable providence.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* By the cross of Your Son, O Full of Grace,* the deception of idolatry was destroyed and the power of the demons was crushed.* Therefore, we faithful always sing to you* and bless you, and confessing: you as the Mother of God, we extol you.\n\n**Canon – Ode 9**\n\n*Hirmos:* With one mind we, the faithful, extol you who beyond all understanding and telling, ineffably gave birth in time to the timeless One.\n*Verse:* Glory be to Your holy cross and crucifixion, O Lord!\nThe might and dominion of the enemy were destroyed, O only almighty Lord, when You were raised upon the cross and bloodied Your hands on it.\n*Verse:* Holy martyrs, pray to God for us!\nO holy martyrs, with radiant mouths you preached God Who became man before the tyrants, and inherited His glory.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* You, who ineffably gave birth to God, we have received as an intercessor and invincible defense, salvation of souls and source of miracles.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nNo sooner was the tree of Your cross planted, O Christ,* than the deception of idols was driven away and grace blossomed forth;* now the cross is no longer a curse or a torture, but a victory and salvation.* For the cross is our glory, the cross is our strength,* the cross is our joy.\nFor our sake You were led as a sheep to sacrifice* and as an innocent lamb to voluntary slaughter, O Christ Emmanuel;* and You were reckoned among iniquitous.* Come, O you nations, and sing hymns and worship the eternal Life* Who was lifted upon the cross.\nBlessed is the army of the King of heaven,* for even though the holy martyrs were mortal,* yet they strived to attain the dignity of the angels;* and having spurned their bodies,* they were counted worthy through sufferings the honor of the bodiless.* Therefore, O Lord, through their prayers, grant us great mercy.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Allay the pains of my much-suffering soul* – the immaculate One begged Christ in her anguish.* Saving mankind by Your sufferings, O Savior, You wound my soul.* You are my Light most sweet, You are my Child and my Creator;* therefore, I glorify Your long-suffering.\n\n## FRIDAY VESPERS\n\n**Stichera at “O Lord, I have cried...”**\n\n*Three stichera of the saint of the day and then the following:*\n*(Podoben – Radyjsia):* With the streams of their blood the martyrs* quenched the flame of grievous ungodliness;* and enkindling the radiance of piety throughout the whole world,* they utterly consumed the false gods and their fetid stench.* They shone forth the most pure light upon those on earth;* and thus enlightened, we avoid the darkness of ungodliness* and the deception of idols, worshiping Christ,* Who grants the world great mercy.\nEasily destroying the deceptive teachings of the ungodly heretics,* you became warriors of the eternal Father,* and the co-eternal Son,* and the Holy Spirit,* one Divinity in three Persons,* teaching the faithful with piety of mind* and confirming the preaching of the true faith.* Therefore, we praise you, all holy pastors,* for on the life-giving pastures you tended the flock of Christ,* for Whom you suffered all manner of pain and every kind of assault.\nThe company of venerable ascetics,* taking reason as their guide in performing virtuous deeds,* easily and completely subdued the carnal passions.* Thus they courageously overcame the wiles of the demons* and became the fellow companions of the angels,* having lived as angels.* Now they rejoice in the heavenly mansions,* living in splendor, and stand before Christ,* asking Him to grant to our souls great mercy.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever: (dogmaticon):* The passing of the Israelites through the Red Sea* was already a foreshadowing of the Virgin-birth.* On that occasion, Moses parted the waters.* At the incarnation, Gabriel announced the miracle of God’s union with Mary.* In ancient times, the Israelites passed through the depths of the sea* without being drenched by the waters;* now the Virgin has given birth to Christ without seed.* After the Israelites passed through the sea, it remained impassible;* after the birth of Emmanuel, the immaculate Virgin remains forever incorrupt.* O God Who exists from all eternity and yet appeared as man, have mercy on us.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nIntercede for us, O holy martyrs,* that we may be delivered from our iniquities;* for the grace to pray for us is given to you.\nWith your souls filled with unquenchable love,* you endured the most terrible sufferings without ever denying Christ,* and you laid low the impudence of the torturers.* You kept the faith unwavering and unharmed, and have gone to dwell in heaven.* Therefore, having the boldness to approach the Lord,* beg Him to grant us His great mercy.\nPutting on the shield of faith* and fortifying themselves with the symbol of the cross,* Your saints, O Lord, bravely went of their own accord to torture.* They defeated the craft and insolence of the Devil.* By their supplications, O all-powerful God,* send peace to the world and great mercy to our souls.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Intercede for us by Your prayers, O joyful One*, and plead for great compassion for our souls,* and the blotting out of our many transgressions.\n\n## SATURDAY MATINS\n\n**Sessional Hymns**\n\n1. The heavenly hosts marveled exceedingly at the struggles of the holy martyrs:* how, fighting the good fight in their mortal bodies,* they invisibly vanquished the incorporeal foe with the power of the cross.* They pray to the Lord that He may have mercy on our souls.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Rejoice, impassable gate of the Lord!* Rejoice, rampart and protection of those who have recourse to you!* Rejoice, haven untouched by storms, you who did not know man!* You gave birth to your Creator and God in the flesh.* Pray without ceasing for those* who glorify and worship the One born of you.\n\n2. Your martyrs, O Lord, envying the cup of Your sufferings,* renounced all the beautiful things of this world* and became fellow partakers with the angels.* Through their prayers grant, O Christ,* peace and great mercy to our souls.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O Christ our God, Who from the Virgin have shone forth to the world,* and through her have shown forth children of light, have mercy on us.\n\n**Canon – Ode 9**\n\n*Hirmos:* Behold the Almighty has done great things for you. He has shown you to be a Virgin even after birthgiving, for you gave birth to your Creator without seed; for this reason, we extol you.\n*Verse:* Holy martyrs, pray to God for us!\nLet the sacred ministers and pastors, the choir of the holy prophets, the countless righteous ones, and the assembly of the martyrs be blessed with sacred hymns, for they pray that our souls be saved.\n*Verse:* All you saints, pray to God for us!\nWith faith and love let the countless multitude of women who suffered and fasted, and who abide with the angelic choirs, be blessed with the hieromartyrs who finished well the race.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O Virgin, having foolishly committed a multitude of sins, we await the coming torments. Therefore, deliver those who with confident heart come to you and turn to your holy protection.\n\n**Aposticha**\n\nBlessed is the army of the King of heaven,* for even though the holy martyrs were mortal,* yet they strived to attain the dignity of the angels;* and having spurned their bodies,* they were counted worthy through sufferings the honor of the bodiless.* Therefore, O Lord, through their prayers,* grant us great mercy.\nYour martyrs, O Lord,* imitators of the angelic choirs,* endured tortures as though they had no bodies,* having only one hope that they would enjoy the good things promised them.* By their prayers, O Christ our God,* grant peace to Your world* and great mercy to our souls.\nStruggling on earth, the holy martyrs endured the cold,* and gave themselves over to the fire.* And as the waters received them, their cry was:* We went through fire and water, and You brought us out into refreshment.* By their supplications, O Christ our God, have mercy on us.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* We bless you, O Virgin Mother of God,* for from you has shone forth the true Sun – Christ,* who grants great mercy.\n\n***\n",
