Amen.\nAlleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to You, O God (3x).\nAs Psalm 103 is being recited, the priest quietly reads the Prayers of Light in front of the holy doors. Only one of the prayers may be read throughout the entire week according to the tone of the week.\nThe Prayers of Light\nO Lord, compassionate and loving, long-suffering and most merciful, hear our prayer and listen to the voice of our supplication. Make a favorable covenant with us, guide us along Your ways that we may live in Your truth, gladden our hearts that we may fear Your holy name; for You are great and You perform wondrous deeds. You are the only God and none other is like You, O Lord. You are great in mercy and able, in Your power, to assist, support, and save all those who place their hope in Your holy name; and to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and adoration, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nO Lord, in Your indignation do not rebuke us; in Your wrath do not chastise us; but deal with us according to Your loving-kindness. O Physician and Healer of our souls, guide us to the harbor of Your will; enlighten the eyes of our mind that we may know Your truth. Grant that the remainder of this day and all the days of our life may be peaceful and without sin, through the prayers of the holy Mother of God and through the prayers of all the saints; for Yours is the might, and Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nO Lord our God, be mindful of us sinners, Your unworthy servants, as we call upon Your holy name, and put us not to shame for having placed our hope in Your mercy. Graciously grant us, O Lord, all the means of salvation; make us worthy to love and fear You with all our heart and to accomplish Your will in all things. For You are a gracious Lord and You love mankind; and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nO Lord, You are praised by the holy powers in hymns which are never silent, and in doxologies which never cease. Fill our mouths with Your praise that we may exalt Your holy name. Through the prayers of the holy Mother of God and the intercession of all Your saints, give us a part and an inheritance with those who fear You in truth and who keep Your commandments. For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and adoration, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nBlessed are You, O Lord, almighty God. You know the mind of each person; You know what each needs even before they ask or are aware of it. Now, O King Who loves mankind and Who is gracious in everything, in Your great mercy allow us to call upon Your holy name with an unashamed conscience. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One; and in Your providence grant all that is beneficial to us. For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and adoration, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nO Lord, O Lord, You hold all things together in Your spotless hands; You are long-suffering toward us all; You grieve at our wickedness. Remember Your compassion and mercy, and visit us in Your goodness. Grant that for the rest of this day we may escape from the manifold deceits of the Evil One; and keep our life free from every assault of the enemy, through the grace of Your all-holy Spirit. Grant this through the mercies and love for mankind of Your only-begotten Son with Whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy, gracious, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nO great and wonderful God, You govern all things with Your indescribable goodness and rich providence. You have provided us with the goodness of this world and have assured us, through Your kindness, of attaining the promised kingdom. O Lord, through all the blessings already received this day, You have kept us away from evil; grant that we spend its remaining hours without blame before Your holy glory, and that we may sing Your praise, O You, the only gracious One Who loves mankind. For You are our God, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nO great and most high God, You alone are immortal and You dwell in a light which is unapproachable. You created all things in Your wisdom, dividing light from darkness, establishing the sun to govern the day and the moon and stars to rule the night. You have deemed us, poor sinners, worthy to reach this hour, to come into Your presence with our thanks, and to offer You our evening praise. O Lord Who loves mankind, let our prayers ascend to You as incense, and accept them as a sweet fragrance. Grant that this evening and the coming night may be spent in peace; clothe us with the armor of light; save us from the fears of the night and from things that lurk in darkness. Grant that the sleep You have given to refresh us from our fatigue may be free from every evil. Yes, O Lord and Giver of all good things, grant that, having found favor in Your sight, we may lie down to rest, remembering Your name throughout the night; and enlightened by the practice of Your commandments, may we rise in gladness of soul to praise Your goodness, offering prayers and supplications for our sins and those of Your people. Look down upon us with mercy, through the intercession of the Mother of God; for You are gracious Lord Who loves mankind, and we glorify You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nAfter the recitation of the Psalm 103, the priest returns to the sanctuary and stands before the altar; the deacon departs through the northern door, stands before the holy doors, and intones the litany. If there is no deacon, the priest intones the litany before the holy doors.",

At Daily Matins take Psalm 50, (p. 128). On Sunday, from September 22 to December 19, and from January 14 to Cheesefare Sunday, as well as on all feasts, take the Polyeleos (Ps. 134-135):\nPolyeleos\nPraise the name of the Lord, praise Him, servants of the Lord. Alleluia! (3x)\nWho stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Alleluia! (3x)\nLord, Your name stands forever, unforgotten from age to age. Alleluia!

Look upon the grave and rejoice, for the Savior is risen from the dead.\nThe ointment-bearing women hastened very early to Your grave. But the angel stood by them and said: The time for lamenting is no more. Do not cry, but go and announce the Resurrection to the disciples.\nO Savior, the ointment-bearing women came to Your grave with ointments, and they heard the angel say to them: Why are you seeking the Living One among the dead? Indeed, He is God. He is risen from the dead.\nGlory be: We worship the Father and His Son and His Holy Spirit, the Holy Trinity, One in essence, and we cry out with the seraphim: Holy, holy, holy are You, O Lord.\nNow and for ever: O Virgin, you bore the Giver of Life, Who redeemed Adam from his sin and granted joy to Eve instead of sadness.

Let us be attentive!\nThe choir sings the resurrectional prokimenon or of the feast. The deacon incenses; if incensing had already been performed at the exaltation, it is not repeated here.\nDeacon: Let us pray to the Lord.\nChoir: Lord, have mercy.\nPriest: For You are holy, our God, and You dwell in the holy place, and to You we give glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever.\nChoir: Amen.

After the reading, the priest closes the Gospel Book, kisses it, and places it upon the tetrapod. The choir reads the Hymn of Resurrection which is immediately taken after the Gospel on all Sundays (except Palm Sunday), everyday from the feast of the Pasch (Resurrection) to its leave-taking on the Ascension of our Lord, on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and on the Saturday of Lazarus. It may be sung according to Tone 6.\nHymn of Resurrection\nHaving beheld the Resurrection of Christ, let us adore the holy Lord Jesus Who alone is sinless. We bow to Your cross, O Christ, and we praise and glorify Your holy Resurrection. You are our God and besides You we recognize no other, and we invoke Your name. Come, all you faithful, and let us bow to the holy Resurrection of Christ, since through the Cross joy has come to all the world. Ever praising the Lord, let us extol His Resurrection, since He, having endured the Crucifixion, has destroyed death by His death.",

A pure heart You have created for us; You have sustained us with a spirit of fervor and have given us the joy of Your help. Do not cast us away from Your presence, but in Your goodness and love for all, grant that we may offer a sacrifice of righteousness and oblation on Your holy altar until our last breath.

Since you are the Mother of God, Who is the Lover of mankind, have mercy, have compassion on us sinners and prodigal sons; accept this prayer from our impure lips, and, with the power of your maternity, beg your Son, our Lord and our God, to open for us the depths of His loving kindness, forgive our countless sins, convert us to true repentance, and make us faithful to His commands: O you who are compassionate, be our constant companion. In this present life, be with us as an intercessor, as a powerful help to turn away the assaults of our enemies and to guide us to salvation. At the hour of our death, be with us to embrace our poor souls and to keep away the dreadful sight of the wicked devils. On the terrible day of judgment, deliver us from eternal punishment and make us heirs of your Son’s glory, through the grace and the love for mankind of your Son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
