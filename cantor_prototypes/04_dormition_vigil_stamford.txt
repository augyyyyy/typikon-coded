   >>> PSALM 103 <<<
   Bless the Lord, O my soul!* You are very great, O Lord, my God,
   Clothed in pomp and brilliance;* arrayed with light as with a cloak.
   Stretching out the sky as a tent-cloth,* covering Your lofty halls with water,
   You make the clouds Your conveyance;* You surge on the wings of the wind.
   You make spirits Your messengers,* and flaming fires Your attendants.
   You settle the earth on its firm foundation;* it shall stand unmoved from age to age.
   The abyss covers it like a garment;* waters stand over the mountains.
   At Your rebuke they will take flight;* at the peal of Your thunder they will fear.
   They hurdle the hills and run down the dales,* to the place You have chosen for them.
   You have set up a boundary not to be passed;* they shall never return to cover the earth.
   Down in the gullies You make springs to rise;* water shall go down between the mountains.
   They shall give drink to the beasts of the field;* wild asses will seek them to quench their thirst.
   The birds of the sky will abide by them;* from among the rocks they will raise their song.
   From Your lofty halls You refresh the mountains;* the earth shall be fed with the fruit of Your works.
   You make green pastures for the cattle,* and food-plants for the service of all,
   So that bread may be brought forth from the earth,* and wine that gladdens the heart of all;
   So that oil may put a gleam upon his face;* and that bread may strengthen the heart of all.
   The trees of the plain will be satisfied,* the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.
   The sparrows will build their nests in them;* and the herons will call them their home.
   To the deer belong high mountains,* to rodents, the shelter of the rocks.
   You have made the moon to mark the seasons;* the sun knows the time of its setting.
   You establish darkness, and it is night,* wherein all the forest creatures prowl around.
   Young lions roar for their prey,* and call out to God for their meat.
   As the sun rises, they will come together,* and lay themselves down in their dens.
   Man will go out to his labor,* and work until eventide.
   How great are Your works, O Lord!* In wisdom You have wrought them all.
   The earth is filled with Your creatures.* Even the wide and open sea itself,
   Within it there are countless creeping things,* living beings small and large.
   Upon it there are ships a-sailing,* and that great beast You made to have fun therein.
   All of them look up to You,* to give them their food in due time.
   You provide and they gather up;* You open Your hand and they are full.
   You hide Your face and they cringe;* You suspend their breath, and they die and return to their dust.
   You send forth Your breath and they live;* You renew the face of the earth.
   May the Lord’s glory endure forever;* may the Lord rejoice in His works;
   He looks upon the earth and makes it quake;* He touches the mountains and they smoke.
   I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;* I will praise my God as long as I last.
   Would that my thoughts be pleasing to Him:* and I will rejoice in the Lord.
   May sinners vanish from the earth, and may the wicked be no more.* Bless the Lord, O my soul!
   Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to You, O God (3x).
   As Psalm 103 is being recited, the priest quietly reads the Prayers of Light in front of the holy doors. Only one of the prayers may be read throughout the entire week according to the tone of the week.
   The Prayers of Light
   O Lord, compassionate and loving, long-suffering and most merciful, hear our prayer and listen to the voice of our supplication. Make a favorable covenant with us, guide us along Your ways that we may live in Your truth, gladden our hearts that we may fear Your holy name; for You are great and You perform wondrous deeds. You are the only God and none other is like You, O Lord. You are great in mercy and able, in Your power, to assist, support, and save all those who place their hope in Your holy name; and to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and adoration, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   O Lord, in Your indignation do not rebuke us; in Your wrath do not chastise us; but deal with us according to Your loving-kindness. O Physician and Healer of our souls, guide us to the harbor of Your will; enlighten the eyes of our mind that we may know Your truth. Grant that the remainder of this day and all the days of our life may be peaceful and without sin, through the prayers of the holy Mother of God and through the prayers of all the saints; for Yours is the might, and Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   O Lord our God, be mindful of us sinners, Your unworthy servants, as we call upon Your holy name, and put us not to shame for having placed our hope in Your mercy. Graciously grant us, O Lord, all the means of salvation; make us worthy to love and fear You with all our heart and to accomplish Your will in all things. For You are a gracious Lord and You love mankind; and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   O Lord, You are praised by the holy powers in hymns which are never silent, and in doxologies which never cease. Fill our mouths with Your praise that we may exalt Your holy name. Through the prayers of the holy Mother of God and the intercession of all Your saints, give us a part and an inheritance with those who fear You in truth and who keep Your commandments. For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and adoration, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   Blessed are You, O Lord, almighty God. You know the mind of each person; You know what each needs even before they ask or are aware of it. Now, O King Who loves mankind and Who is gracious in everything, in Your great mercy allow us to call upon Your holy name with an unashamed conscience. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One; and in Your providence grant all that is beneficial to us. For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and adoration, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   O Lord, O Lord, You hold all things together in Your spotless hands; You are long-suffering toward us all; You grieve at our wickedness. Remember Your compassion and mercy, and visit us in Your goodness. Grant that for the rest of this day we may escape from the manifold deceits of the Evil One; and keep our life free from every assault of the enemy, through the grace of Your all-holy Spirit. Grant this through the mercies and love for mankind of Your only-begotten Son with Whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy, gracious, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   O great and wonderful God, You govern all things with Your indescribable goodness and rich providence. You have provided us with the goodness of this world and have assured us, through Your kindness, of attaining the promised kingdom. O Lord, through all the blessings already received this day, You have kept us away from evil; grant that we spend its remaining hours without blame before Your holy glory, and that we may sing Your praise, O You, the only gracious One Who loves mankind. For You are our God, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   O great and most high God, You alone are immortal and You dwell in a light which is unapproachable. You created all things in Your wisdom, dividing light from darkness, establishing the sun to govern the day and the moon and stars to rule the night. You have deemed us, poor sinners, worthy to reach this hour, to come into Your presence with our thanks, and to offer You our evening praise. O Lord Who loves mankind, let our prayers ascend to You as incense, and accept them as a sweet fragrance. Grant that this evening and the coming night may be spent in peace; clothe us with the armor of light; save us from the fears of the night and from things that lurk in darkness. Grant that the sleep You have given to refresh us from our fatigue may be free from every evil. Yes, O Lord and Giver of all good things, grant that, having found favor in Your sight, we may lie down to rest, remembering Your name throughout the night; and enlightened by the practice of Your commandments, may we rise in gladness of soul to praise Your goodness, offering prayers and supplications for our sins and those of Your people. Look down upon us with mercy, through the intercession of the Mother of God; for You are gracious Lord Who loves mankind, and we glorify You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.
   After the recitation of the Psalm 103, the priest returns to the sanctuary and stands before the altar; the deacon departs through the northern door, stands before the holy doors, and intones the litany. If there is no deacon, the priest intones the litany before the holy doors.

   God the Lord
   After the Litany, the choir sings God the Lord... (Ps. 117) in the tone of the first troparion:
   God the Lord has revealed Himself to us, blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord.
   Verse: Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His love endures forever.
   Verse: They encircled me, compassed me about; in the Lord’s name I crushed them.
   Verse: I shall not die, I shall live and recount the deeds of the Lord.

   Instead of God the Lord..., the choir sings according to the tone of the week: Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

   Then the choir immediately sings the following trinitarian hymns in the tone of the week.
   Tone 1
   Through bodily forms, we have come to the spiritual, immaterial understanding of the bodiless powers, and by the singing of the thrice-holy hymn, we have received the light of the divinity in three Persons. Let us sing with the cherubim to our only Lord: Holy, holy, holy are You, O our God...

   Tone 6
   With fear and trembling, the cherubim and seraphim sing the Thrice-holy Hymn with unceasing voice; and we sinners also cry out with them: Holy, holy, holy are You, O our God... (see p. 120).

   Now and for ever: Overwhelmed by the weight of our many sins, we dare not raise our eyes to heaven. With souls and bodies bowed before You, we sing together with the angels: Holy, holy, holy are You, O our God; through the prayers of the Mother of God, have mercy on us.
   After the troparia, we sing the Sessional hymns. At Daily Matins take Psalm 50, (p. 128). On Sunday, from September 22 to December 19, and from January 14 to Cheesefare Sunday, as well as on all feasts, take the Polyeleos (Ps. 134-135):
   Polyeleos
   Praise the name of the Lord, praise Him, servants of the Lord. Alleluia! (3x)
   Who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Alleluia! (3x)
   Lord, Your name stands forever, unforgotten from age to age. Alleluia! (3x)
   From Zion may the Lord be blessed, He who dwells in Jerusalem. Alleluia! (3x)
   O give thanks to the Lord for He is good, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   Who fixed the earth firmly on the seas, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   He snatched us away from our foes, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   To the God of heaven give thanks, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   After the Polyeleos, if it is a feast, the Exaltation is sung. The priest, vested in the phelonion, opens the holy doors, sings the Exaltation, and incenses the altar, sanctuary, icons, the people, and the icon of the feast on the tetrapod.
   Hosts of Angels
   (On all Sundays and on the Saturday of Lazarus)
   Verse before each troparion: Blessed are You, O Lord, teach me Your commandments.
   The hosts of angels were amazed and dazzled when they beheld You, O Savior, among the dead destroying the power of Death, raising up Adam with You and releasing all the souls from Hades.
   The radiant angel standing by the grave cried out to the ointment-bearing women: Why do you lament and mingle your tears with the spices? Look upon the grave and rejoice, for the Savior is risen from the dead.
   The ointment-bearing women hastened very early to Your grave. But the angel stood by them and said: The time for lamenting is no more. Do not cry, but go and announce the Resurrection to the disciples.
   O Savior, the ointment-bearing women came to Your grave with ointments, and they heard the angel say to them: Why are you seeking the Living One among the dead? Indeed, He is God. He is risen from the dead.
   Glory be: We worship the Father and His Son and His Holy Spirit, the Holy Trinity, One in essence, and we cry out with the seraphim: Holy, holy, holy are You, O Lord.
   Now and for ever: O Virgin, you bore the Giver of Life, Who redeemed Adam from his sin and granted joy to Eve instead of sadness. For He Who is both God and Man was incarnate of you, and He has restored life to those who had strayed away from it.
   Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to You, O God! (3x)
   The Exaltation and the hymn Hosts of angels... are followed by the Small Litany, the Hypakoe (for Sunday, see pp. 1231-1233); the Sessional (on feasts), and the Gradual according to the tone of the week (on Sunday); on feasts according to tone 4.
   Gradual Hymn (Tone 4)
   My sinful desires have encircled me, from my youth they have oppressed me; but You, O Savior, will come to aid me. You will protect and save me.
   May the enemies of Zion be confounded by the Lord; may they be a grass which withers, which is dried up by the fire.
   Glory be: Now and for ever: Every spirit lives by the grace of the Holy Spirit, and is raised up in all purity; it is mystically enlightened by the one God in three Persons.
   The Gospel
   Deacon: Let us be attentive!
   Priest: Peace + be with all.
   Deacon: Wisdom! Let us be attentive!
   The choir sings the resurrectional prokimenon or of the feast. The deacon incenses; if incensing had already been performed at the exaltation, it is not repeated here.
   Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.
   Choir: Lord, have mercy.
   Priest: For You are holy, our God, and You dwell in the holy place, and to You we give glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever.
   Choir: Amen. Then immediately according to the tone of the prokimenon: Let everything that breathes give praise to the Lord.
   Verse: Praise God in His holy place, praise Him in His mighty heavens.
   Deacon: That we be deemed worthy of hearing the holy Gospel, let us pray to the Lord, our God.
   Choir: Lord, have mercy. (3x)
   Deacon: Wisdom! Let us stand and listen to a reading of the holy Gospel.
   Priest: Peace + be with all.
   Choir: And with your spirit.
   Priest: A reading of the holy Gospel according to (name of the Evangelist).
   Choir: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You!
   Deacon: Let us be attentive!
   The priest alone reads the Gospel (see pp. 413-429). After the reading, the priest closes the Gospel Book, kisses it, and places it upon the tetrapod. The choir reads the Hymn of Resurrection which is immediately taken after the Gospel on all Sundays (except Palm Sunday), everyday from the feast of the Pasch (Resurrection) to its leave-taking on the Ascension of our Lord, on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and on the Saturday of Lazarus. It may be sung according to Tone 6.
   Hymn of Resurrection
   Having beheld the Resurrection of Christ, let us adore the holy Lord Jesus Who alone is sinless. We bow to Your cross, O Christ, and we praise and glorify Your holy Resurrection. You are our God and besides You we recognize no other, and we invoke Your name. Come, all you faithful, and let us bow to the holy Resurrection of Christ, since through the Cross joy has come to all the world. Ever praising the Lord, let us extol His Resurrection, since He, having endured the Crucifixion, has destroyed death by His death.

   After the troparia, we sing the Sessional hymns. At Daily Matins take Psalm 50, (p. 128). On Sunday, from September 22 to December 19, and from January 14 to Cheesefare Sunday, as well as on all feasts, take the Polyeleos (Ps. 134-135):
   Polyeleos
   Praise the name of the Lord, praise Him, servants of the Lord. Alleluia! (3x)
   Who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Alleluia! (3x)
   Lord, Your name stands forever, unforgotten from age to age. Alleluia! (3x)
   From Zion may the Lord be blessed, He who dwells in Jerusalem. Alleluia! (3x)
   O give thanks to the Lord for He is good, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   Who fixed the earth firmly on the seas, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   He snatched us away from our foes, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   To the God of heaven give thanks, alleluia, for His love endures forever. Alleluia! (3x)
   After the Polyeleos, if it is a feast, the Exaltation is sung. The priest, vested in the phelonion, opens the holy doors, sings the Exaltation, and incenses the altar, sanctuary, icons, the people, and the icon of the feast on the tetrapod.
   Hosts of Angels
   (On all Sundays and on the Saturday of Lazarus)
   Verse before each troparion: Blessed are You, O Lord, teach me Your commandments.
   The hosts of angels were amazed and dazzled when they beheld You, O Savior, among the dead destroying the power of Death, raising up Adam with You and releasing all the souls from Hades.
   The radiant angel standing by the grave cried out to the ointment-bearing women: Why do you lament and mingle your tears with the spices? Look upon the grave and rejoice, for the Savior is risen from the dead.
   The ointment-bearing women hastened very early to Your grave. But the angel stood by them and said: The time for lamenting is no more. Do not cry, but go and announce the Resurrection to the disciples.
   O Savior, the ointment-bearing women came to Your grave with ointments, and they heard the angel say to them: Why are you seeking the Living One among the dead? Indeed, He is God. He is risen from the dead.
   Glory be: We worship the Father and His Son and His Holy Spirit, the Holy Trinity, One in essence, and we cry out with the seraphim: Holy, holy, holy are You, O Lord.
   Now and for ever: O Virgin, you bore the Giver of Life, Who redeemed Adam from his sin and granted joy to Eve instead of sadness. For He Who is both God and Man was incarnate of you, and He has restored life to those who had strayed away from it.
   Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Glory be to You, O God! (3x)
   The Exaltation and the hymn Hosts of angels... are followed by the Small Litany, the Hypakoe (for Sunday, see pp. 1231-1233); the Sessional (on feasts), and the Gradual according to the tone of the week (on Sunday); on feasts according to tone 4.
   Gradual Hymn (Tone 4)
   My sinful desires have encircled me, from my youth they have oppressed me; but You, O Savior, will come to aid me. You will protect and save me.
   May the enemies of Zion be confounded by the Lord; may they be a grass which withers, which is dried up by the fire.
   Glory be: Now and for ever: Every spirit lives by the grace of the Holy Spirit, and is raised up in all purity; it is mystically enlightened by the one God in three Persons.
   The Gospel
   Deacon: Let us be attentive!
   Priest: Peace + be with all.
   Deacon: Wisdom! Let us be attentive!
   The choir sings the resurrectional prokimenon or of the feast. The deacon incenses; if incensing had already been performed at the exaltation, it is not repeated here.
   Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.
   Choir: Lord, have mercy.
   Priest: For You are holy, our God, and You dwell in the holy place, and to You we give glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever.
   Choir: Amen. Then immediately according to the tone of the prokimenon: Let everything that breathes give praise to the Lord.
   Verse: Praise God in His holy place, praise Him in His mighty heavens.
   Deacon: That we be deemed worthy of hearing the holy Gospel, let us pray to the Lord, our God.
   Choir: Lord, have mercy. (3x)
   Deacon: Wisdom! Let us stand and listen to a reading of the holy Gospel.
   Priest: Peace + be with all.
   Choir: And with your spirit.
   Priest: A reading of the holy Gospel according to (name of the Evangelist).
   Choir: Glory be to You, O Lord, glory be to You!
   Deacon: Let us be attentive!
   The priest alone reads the Gospel (see pp. 413-429). After the reading, the priest closes the Gospel Book, kisses it, and places it upon the tetrapod. The choir reads the Hymn of Resurrection which is immediately taken after the Gospel on all Sundays (except Palm Sunday), everyday from the feast of the Pasch (Resurrection) to its leave-taking on the Ascension of our Lord, on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and on the Saturday of Lazarus. It may be sung according to Tone 6.
   Hymn of Resurrection
   Having beheld the Resurrection of Christ, let us adore the holy Lord Jesus Who alone is sinless. We bow to Your cross, O Christ, and we praise and glorify Your holy Resurrection. You are our God and besides You we recognize no other, and we invoke Your name. Come, all you faithful, and let us bow to the holy Resurrection of Christ, since through the Cross joy has come to all the world. Ever praising the Lord, let us extol His Resurrection, since He, having endured the Crucifixion, has destroyed death by His death.

Lord, I Call (Tone ?)
