  "content": "(Tone 8): When You showed Yourself to the disciples* after Your resurrection, O Savior, * You appointed Simon to watch over Your sheep* as a recompense for His love; * You asked him to tend the flock with care.* You said to him: If you love Me, O Peter,* feed my lambs and feed my sheep.* But at once he inquired concerning the other disciple,* revealing him to be the beloved.* Therefore, by the intercession of both, O Christ,* keep Your flock from the ravaging wolves.",
