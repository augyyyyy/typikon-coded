  "content": "(Tone 3): The disciples were rebuked for the hardness of their hearts* because they doubted when Mary Magdalene proclaimed to them* the resurrection of the Savior and His appearance to her.* But when they were strengthened with miracles and wonders,* they were sent out to preach.* And when You, O Lord, ascended to Your Father, the Source of all light,* the disciples preached throughout the world* verifying their words with wonders and miracles.* Therefore, we who were enlightened by them,* glorify Your resurrection from the dead, O Lover of mankind.",
