  "content": "(Tone 4): The women came at early dawn to Your tomb, O Christ,* but they did not find Your venerable body.* As they were perplexed, an angel in shining clothes said to them:* Why do you seek the Living among the dead?* He is risen as He foretold.* Have you forgotten what He said?* Being assured by the words of the angel,* the women preached to the disciples about the things they saw.* But their good news was received with ridicule;* for the disciples were still without understanding.* Peter, however, hastened to Your tomb* and then glorified Your wonders, O Lord.",
