  "content": "(Tone 5): How wise are Your judgments, O Christ!* You granted Peter the understanding of Your resurrection by the burial wrappings alone.* Even though You accompanied Luke and Cleopas and conversed with them,* yet You did not reveal Yourself.* You were taunted by them as though You alone were a stranger in Jerusalem,* not knowing what had recently happened there.* But since You ordained all things for the good of each,* You explained to them what the prophets had spoken concerning You.* In the breaking of the bread they recognized You* because their hearts were already burning with the desire to know You.* When they came together with the disciples,* they proclaimed openly Your divine resurrection* by which we ask that You have mercy upon us.",
