  "content": "(Tone 6): After Your descent into Hades, O Christ,* and Your resurrection from the dead, the disciples grieved over Your departure.* They returned to their occupations* and attended to their nets and their boats,* but their fishing was in vain.* You appeared to them since You are Lord of all;* You commanded them to cast the nets on the right side.* Immediately Your word became deed.* They caught a great number of fish,* and they found an unexpected meal prepared for them on the shore,* which they immediately ate.* Now, make us worthy to enjoy this meal with them in a spiritual manner,* O Lord and Lover of mankind.",
