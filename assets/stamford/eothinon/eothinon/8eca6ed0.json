  "content": "(Tone 6): Since You are the true peace of God for us, O Christ,* You gave Your peace to Your disciples after Your resurrection.* They were frightened when they thought that they were beholding a spirit.* But You removed the anxiety of their hearts when You showed them Your hands and feet,* yet they were still in doubt.* But when You took food with them, reminding them of Your preaching,* You opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.* You made the eternal covenant with them;* You, blessed them and rose, ascending into heaven. Therefore, with them, we worship You;* O Lord, glory to You!",
