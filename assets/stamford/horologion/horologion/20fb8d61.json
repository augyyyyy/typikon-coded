  "content": "O Lady, bride of God, virginal, pure, immaculate, blameless, without stain or disgrace, who through your birthgiving brought together our fallen state and the things of heaven; O you, only hope of the hopeless, help of the oppressed, ready protection of those who flee to you and refuge of all Christians: despise us not who are wretched sinners, who have defiled ourselves with unclean thoughts, words and deeds, and in our slothfulness have become slaves to the passions of life. Since you are the Mother of God, Who is the Lover of mankind, have mercy, have compassion on us sinners and prodigal sons; accept this prayer from our impure lips, and, with the power of your maternity, beg your Son, our Lord and our God, to open for us the depths of His loving kindness, forgive our countless sins, convert us to true repentance, and make us faithful to His commands: O you who are compassionate, be our constant companion. In this present life, be with us as an intercessor, as a powerful help to turn away the assaults of our enemies and to guide us to salvation. At the hour of our death, be with us to embrace our poor souls and to keep away the dreadful sight of the wicked devils. On the terrible day of judgment, deliver us from eternal punishment and make us heirs of your Son’s glory, through the grace and the love for mankind of your Son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him and to His eternal Father, and to His all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, we render glory, honor, and adoration, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen.",
