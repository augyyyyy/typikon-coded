  "content": "(Monday and Thursday)\nHow lovely is Your dwelling-place,* Lord, God of hosts.\nMy soul is longing and yearning,* is yearning for the courts of the Lord.\nMy heart and my soul ring out their joy to God,* the living God.\nThe sparrow herself finds a home and the swallow a nest for her brood;* she lays her young by Your altars,\nLord of hosts,* my king and my God.\nThey are happy, who dwell in Your house,* forever singing Your praise.\nThey are happy, whose strength is in You,* in whose hearts are the roads to Zion.\nAs they go through the Bitter Valley they make it a place of springs,* the autumn rain covers it with blessings.\nThey walk with ever-growing strength,* they will see the God of gods in Zion.\nO Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer,* give ear, O God of Jacob.\nTurn Your eyes, O God, our shield,* look on the face of Your anointed.\nOne day within Your courts* is better than a thousand elsewhere.\nThe threshold of the house of God* I prefer to the dwellings of the wicked.\nFor the Lord God is a rampart, a shield;* He will give us His favor and glory.\nThe Lord will not refuse any good* to those who walk without blame.\nLord, God of hosts,* happy are those who trust in You!",
