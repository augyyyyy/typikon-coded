  "content": "Lord my God, I call for help by day;* I cry at night before You.\nLet my prayer come into Your presence.* O turn Your ear to my cry.\nFor my soul is filled with evils;* my life is on the brink of the grave.\nI am reckoned as one in the tomb* I have reached the end of my strength.\nLike one alone among the dead;* like the slain lying in their graves;\nLike those You remember no more,* cut off, as they are, from Your hand.\nYou have laid me in the depths of the tomb,* in places that are dark, in the depths.\nYour anger weighs down upon me;* I am drowned beneath Your waves.\nYou have taken away my friends* and made me hateful in their sight.\nImprisoned, I cannot escape;* my eyes are sunken with grief.\nI call to You, Lord, all the day long;* to You I stretch out my hands.\nWill You work Your wonders for the dead?* Will the shades stand and praise You?\nWill Your love be told in the grave* or Your faithfulness among the dead?\nWill Your wonders be known in the dark* or Your justice in the land of oblivion?\nAs for me, Lord, I call to You for help;* in the morning my prayer comes before You.\nLord, why do You reject me?* Why do You hide Your face?\nWretched, close to death from my youth,* I have borne Your trials; I am numb.\nYour fury has swept down upon me;* Your terrors have utterly destroyed me.\nThey surround me all the day like a flood,* they assail me all together.\nFriend and neighbor You have taken away;* my one companion is darkness.",
