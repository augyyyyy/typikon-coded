  "content": "(Monday and Thursday)\nLord, hear a cause that is just,* pay heed to my cry.\nTurn Your ear to my prayer,* no deceit is on my lips.\nFrom You may my judgment come forth.* Your eyes discern the truth.\nYou search my heart, You visit me by night.* You test me and You find in me no wrong.\nMy words are not sinful like human words.* I kept from violence because of Your word,\nI kept my feet firmly in Your paths;* there was no faltering in my steps.\nI am here and I call, You will hear me, O God.* Turn Your ear to me; hear my words.\nDisplay Your great love,* You Whose right hand saves Your friends from those who rebel against them.\nGuard me as the apple of Your eye.* Hide me in the shadow of Your wings from the violent attack of the wicked.\nMy foes encircle me with deadly intent.* Their hearts tight shut, their mouths speak proudly.\nThey advance against me,* and now they surround me.\nTheir eyes are watching to strike me to the ground, as though they were lions ready to claw* or like a young lion crouched in hiding.\nLord, arise, confront them, strike them down!* Let Your sword rescue my soul from the wicked;\nLet Your hand, O Lord, rescue me from my enemy,* from those whose reward is in this present life.\nYou give them their fill of Your treasures;* they rejoice in abundance of offspring and leave their wealth to their children.\nAs for me, in my justice I shall see Your face and be filled,* when I awake, with the sight of Your glory.",
