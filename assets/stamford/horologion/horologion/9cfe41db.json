  "content": "Sing a new song to the Lord,* His praise in the assembly of the faithful.\nLet Israel rejoice in its Maker;* let Zion’s sons exalt in their king.\nLet them praise His name with dancing* and make music with timbrel and harp.\nFor the Lord takes delight in His people.* He crowns the poor with salvation.\nLet the faithful rejoice in their glory,* shout for joy and take their rest.\nLet the praise of God be on their lips* and a two-edged sword in their hand,\nTo deal out vengeance to the nations* and punishment on all the peoples;\nTo bind their kings in chains* and their nobles in fetters of iron.\n(If 6 stichera are taken) To carry out the sentence preordained* this honor is for all His faithful.",
