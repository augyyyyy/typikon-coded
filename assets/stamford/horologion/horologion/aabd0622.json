  "content": "With all my heart I extol You, Lord, for You looked with favor upon my lowliness and did not leave me in the hands of my enemies. You saved my soul from distress. Now, Master, let Your hand shelter me. May Your mercy come upon me, for my soul is troubled and in anguish as it leaves my wretched body. Do not let the evil adversary ever lie in wait to attack it and to cast it into darkness because of my sins committed in this life knowingly and unknowingly. Be merciful to me, Master. Let my soul not see the dark and gloomy vision of the evil demons. Rather, let Your bright and shining angels receive it. Give glory to Your holy name and by Your power bring me to Your divine tribunal. At my judgment may not the hand of the prince of this world lay hold of me, to drag me, though a sinner, down to the depths of the infernal abyss. Rather, stand by me and be my savior and my protector. Lord, have mercy on my soul stained by the passions of this life. Receive it purified by repentance and confession, for blessed are You for ever. Amen.\nSUNDAY NOCTURN\n(Saturday Evening)\nPriest: Blessed be our God, always, now and for ever and ever.\nChoir: Amen. Glory be to You, our God...; (the usual beginning: until: Come, let us adore..., (pp. 10-11).",
