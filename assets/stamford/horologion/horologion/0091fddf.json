  "content": "O God, You are my God, for You I long;* for You my soul is thirsting.\nMy body pines for You* like a dry, weary land without water.\nSo I gaze on You in the sanctuary* to see Your strength and Your glory.\nFor Your love is better than life,* my lips will speak Your praise.\nSo I will bless You all my life;* in Your name I will lift up my hands.\nMy soul shall be filled as with a banquet,* my mouth shall praise You with joy.\nOn my bed I remember You.* On You I muse throughout the night\nFor You have been my help;* in the shadow of Your wings I rejoice.\nMy soul clings to You;* Your right hand holds me fast.\nThose who seek to destroy my life* shall go down to the depths of the earth.\nThey shall be put into the power of the sword* and left as the prey of the jackals.\nBut the king shall rejoice in God;* all that swear by Him shall be blessed for the mouth of liars shall be silenced.",
