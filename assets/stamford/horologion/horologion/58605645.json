  "content": "(Tuesday and Friday)\nO Lord, You once favored Your land* and revived the fortunes of Jacob,\nYou forgave the guilt of Your people* and covered all their sins.\nYou averted all Your rage, You calmed the heat of Your anger.* Revive us now, God, our helper!\nPut an end to Your grievance against us.* Will You be angry with us forever, will Your anger never cease?\nWill You not restore again our life* that Your people may rejoice in You?\nLet us see, O Lord, Your mercy* and give us Your saving help.\nI will hear what the Lord God has to say,* a voice that speaks of peace,\nPeace for His people and His friends* and those who turn to Him in their hearts.\nHis help is near for those who fear Him* and His glory will dwell in our land.\nMercy and faithfulness have met;* justice and peace have embraced.\nFaithfulness shall spring from the earth* and justice look down from heaven.\nThe Lord will make us prosper* and our earth shall yield its fruit.\nJustice shall march before Him* and peace shall follow His steps.",
