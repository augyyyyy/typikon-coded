  "content": "(Monday and Thursday)\nTo my words give ear, O Lord,* give heed to my groaning,\nAttend to the sound of my cries, my King and my God.* It is You Whom I invoke, O Lord.\nIn the morning You hear me;* in the morning I offer You my prayer, watching and waiting.\nYou are no God Who loves evil;* no sinner is Your guest.\nThe boastful shall not stand their ground before Your face.* You hate all who do evil;\nYou destroy all who lie.* Deceitful and bloodthirsty people are hateful to You, O Lord.\nBut I through the greatness of Your love* have access to Your house.\nI bow down before Your holy temple,* filled with awe.\nLead me, Lord, in Your justice, because of those who lie in wait;* make clear Your way before me.\nNo truth can be found in their mouths,* their heart is all mischief,\nTheir throat a wide-open grave,* all honey their speech.\nDeclare them guilty, O God.* Let them fall in their designs.\nDrive them out for their many offenses,* for they have defied You.\nAll those You protect shall be glad* and ring out their joy.\nYou shelter them;* in You they rejoice, those who love Your name.\nLord, it is You Who bless the upright;* You surround them with favor as with a shield.",
