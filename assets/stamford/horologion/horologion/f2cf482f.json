  "content": "(Tuesday Evening)\nLord, do not reprove me in Your anger:* punish me not in Your rage.\nHave mercy on me, Lord, I have no strength;* Lord, heal me, my body is racked;\nMy soul is racked with pain.* But You, O Lord ... how long?\nReturn, Lord, rescue my soul.* Save me in Your merciful love,\nFor in death no one remembers You;* from the grave, who can give You praise?\nI am exhausted with my groaning;* every night I drench my pillow with tears;* I bedew my bed with weeping.\nMy eye wastes away with grief;* I have grown old surrounded by my foes.\nLeave me, all you who do evil;* for the Lord has heard my weeping.\nThe Lord has heard my plea;* the Lord will accept my prayer.\nAll my foes will retire in confusion,* foiled and suddenly confounded.",
