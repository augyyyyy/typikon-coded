  "content": "With my voice I cried to the Lord;* with all my voice I implored the Lord.\nBefore Him I pour out my supplications;* before Him I declare my distress.\nWhen my breath was escaping me,* then you knew my paths;\nOn the road upon which I was walking,* they set up snares for me.\nI looked to my right and observed* there was no one friendly to me;\nEven flight was denied me;* there was no one to take care of my life.\nI cried out to You, O Lord, and said:* You are my hope, my share in the land of the living.\nListen to my supplication,* for I am laid very low.\nDeliver me from my oppressors;* for they have overwhelmed me.\n(If 10 stichera are taken) Lead my soul forth from prison* that I may give thanks to Your name.\nThe just shall gather around me* when You have been good to me.",
