  "content": "I lift up my eyes to the mountains.* From where shall come my help?\nMy help shall come from the Lord* Who made heaven and earth.\nMay He never allow you to stumble! Let Him sleep not, your guard.\nNo, He sleeps not nor slumbers,* Israel’s guard.\nThe Lord is your guard and your shade;* at your right side He stands.\nBy day the sun shall not smite you* nor the moon in the night.\nThe Lord will guard you from evil,* He will guard your soul.\nThe Lord will guard your going and coming* both now and for ever.",
