  "content": "On Saturday evening and on all the feast days, the deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, performs the incensing as prescribed by the typikon. The choir sings the first two verses of Psalm 140 according to the tone of the first sticherion.\nO Lord, I have cried to You,* hear me; hear me, O Lord!* O Lord, I have cried to You, hear me;* receive the voice of my prayer* when I call upon You.* Hear me, O Lord!\nLet my prayer rise like incense before You;* and the lifting up of my hands as an evening sacrifice.* Hear me, O Lord!\nSet a guard, O Lord, before my mouth* and a portal around my lips.\nIncline my heart away from evil dealings,* from finding excuses for sinful deeds.\nIn company with those who work iniquity,* let me not partake of what they choose.\nMay the just chasten me with justice and reprove me;* may the oil of the wicked never touch my head.\nYet even then shall I pray for their welfare.* Their rulers were swallowed near the rock.\nMy words will be heard,* for they were sweet.\nAs a lump of clay broken on the ground,* so their bones were strewn near the grave.\nTo You, Lord, O Lord, my eyes are lifted up.* In You have I hoped; let not my soul be lost.\nKeep me from the snare that was set for me,* and from the stumbling-blocks of the wicked.\nThe wicked shall fall into their own nets,* while I remain alone until I can escape.",
