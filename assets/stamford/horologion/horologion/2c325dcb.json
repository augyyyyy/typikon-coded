  "content": "O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger;* do not punish me, Lord, in Your rage.\nYour arrows have sunk deep in me;* Your hand has come down upon me.\nThrough Your anger all my body is sick:* through my sin, there is no health in my limbs.\nMy guilt towers higher than my head:* it is a weight too heavy to bear.\nMy wounds are foul and festering,* the result of my own folly.\nI am bowed and brought to my knees.* I go mourning all the day long.\nAll my frame burns with fever;* all my body is sick.\nSpent and utterly crushed,* I cry aloud in anguish of heart.\nO Lord, You know all my longing:* my groans are not hidden from You.\nMy heart throbs, my strength is spent;* the very light has gone from my eyes.\nMy friends avoid me like a leper;* those closest to me stand afar off.\nThose who plot against my life lay snares;* those who seek my ruin speak of harm, planning treachery all the day long.\nBut I am like the deaf who cannot hear;* like the dumb unable to speak.\nI am like one who hears nothing* in whose mouth is no defense.\nI count on You, O Lord:* it is You, Lord God, Who will answer.\nI pray: Do not let them mock me,* those who triumph if my foot should slip.\nFor I am on the point of falling* and my pain is always before me.\nI confess that I am guilty* and my sin fills me with dismay.\nMy wanton enemies are numberless* and my lying foes are many.\nThey repay me evil for good* and attack me for seeking what is right.\nO Lord, do not forsake me!* My God, do not stay afar off!\nMake haste and come to my help,* O Lord, my God, my Savior!",
