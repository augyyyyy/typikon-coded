  "content": "O God, Lord of Powers and Maker of the whole creation, through Your compassion beyond our understanding, You sent down Your only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race. Through His cross He cancelled the debt of our sins and triumphed over the powers and masters of darkness. Now accept from us sinners these prayers of thanksgiving and petition, and preserve us from any deadly fall in the darkness and against every visible and invisible enemy who may seek our harm. Pierce our bodies with fear of You, and let not our souls fall into evil words or thoughts, but, instead, wound them with longing for You so that, looking upon You at all times and guided by the light that emanates from You, we may contemplate the unapproachable eternal light. May we ever address our thanksgiving and worship to You, O eternal Father, and to Your only-begotten Son, and to Your all-holy, gracious, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever.",
