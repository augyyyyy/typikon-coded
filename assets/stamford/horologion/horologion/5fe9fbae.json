  "content": "(Tuesday and Friday)\nTo You, O Lord, I lift up my soul;* I trust You.\nLet me not be disappointed;* do not let my enemies triumph.\nThose who hope in You shall not be disappointed,* but only those who wantonly break faith.\nLord, make me know Your ways* Lord, teach me Your paths.\nMake me walk in Your truth, and teach me,* for You are God my Savior.\nIn You I hope all day long* because of Your goodness, O Lord.\nRemember Your mercy, Lord,* and the love You have shown from of old.\nDo not remember the sins of my youth.* In Your love remember me.\nThe Lord is good and upright.* He shows the path to those who stray,\nHe guides the humble in the right path,* He teaches His way to the poor.\nHis ways are faithfulness and love* for those who keep His covenant and will.\nLord, for the sake of Your name forgive my guilt,* for it is great.\nTo those who revere the Lord* He will show the path they should choose.\nTheir souls will live in happiness* and their children shall possess the land.\nThe Lord’s friendship is for those who revere Him;* to them He reveals His covenant.\nMy eyes are always on the Lord,* for He rescues my feet from the snare.\nTurn to me and have mercy* for I am lonely and poor.\nRelieve the anguish of my heart* and set me free from my distress.\nSee my affliction and my toil* and take all my sins away.\nSee how many are my foes,* how violent their hatred for me.\nPreserve my life and rescue me.* Do not disappoint me, You are my refuge.\nMay innocence and uprightness protect me,* for my hope is in You, O Lord.\nRedeem Israel, O God,* from all its distress.",
