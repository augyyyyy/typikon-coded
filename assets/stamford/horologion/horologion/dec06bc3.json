  "content": "(Tuesday and Friday)\nO Lord, You have been our refuge* from one generation to the next.\nBefore the mountains were born or the earth or the world brought forth,* You are God, without beginning or end.\nYou turn us back into dust and say:* Go back, children of the earth.\nTo Your eyes a thousand years are like yesterday, come and gone,* no more than a watch in the night.\nYou sweep us away like a dream,* like grass which springs up in the morning.\nIn the morning it springs up and flowers;* by evening it withers and fades.\nSo we are destroyed in Your anger,* struck with terror in Your fury.\nOur guilt lies open before You,* our secrets in the light of Your face.\nAll our days pass away in Your anger.* Our life is over like a sigh.\nOur span is seventy years,* or eighty for those who are strong.\nAnd most of these are emptiness and pain.* They pass swiftly and we are gone.\nWho understands the power of Your anger* and fears the strength of Your fury?\nMake us know the shortness of our life* that we may gain wisdom of heart.\nLord, relent! Is Your anger for ever?* Show pity to Your servants.\nIn the morning, fill us with Your love;* we shall exult and rejoice all our days.\nGive us joy to balance our affliction* for the years when we knew misfortune.\nShow forth Your work to Your servants;* let Your glory shine on their children.\nLet the favor of the Lord be upon us:* give success to the work of our hands; give success to the work of our hands.",
