  "title": "Prayer of the Ninth Hour",
  "content": "O Master, Lord Jesus Christ, You patiently endured our sins and led us to this very hour at which You were hung upon the life-giving wood. You opened a way to paradise for the penitent thief, and crushed Death by Your death. Now forgive the trespasses that we Your servants have committed, unworthy sinners that we are. We have sinned indeed and transgressed Your law. We are unworthy even to lift up our eyes to heaven, for we have abandoned the path of Your holiness and pursued the desires of our hearts. But now we implore Your immense goodness: Spare us, O Lord, in the multitude of Your mercies; save us for the sake of Your most holy name: Our days were spent in vanity; wrest us from the hands of our enemy, and forgive our sins. Subdue in us the cravings of our flesh, so that, after putting off the old, we may put on the new and live for You, our Lord and Benefactor; and that, obeying Your commandments, we may reach eternal repose in the place where all the blessed abide; for You are truly joy and delight to those who love You, O Christ our God. We send up glory to You, and to Your eternal Father, and to your all-holy, gracious, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nPriest: Glory be to You, O Christ our God, our hope; glory be to You.\nChoir: Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\nLord, have mercy (3x). Give the blessing.\nPriest: Christ our true God, through the prayers of His immaculate Mother; of our venerable and God-bearing fathers; and of all the saints, will have mercy and save us, for He is good and loves mankind.\nChoir: Amen.\nTHE TYPICA\nOutside of the Great Fast, this service may begin immediately after the prayer of the Sixth Hour; however, during the Great Fast – see the Ninth Hour. During the Great Fast, Psalms 102, 145, and Only-Begotten Son are omitted. Immediately begin: Remember us, O Lord...",
