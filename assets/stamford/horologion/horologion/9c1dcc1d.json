  "content": "O Lord, O Lord, Who delivered us from every arrow that flies in the light of day, protect us against any difficulty that lurks around at night, and accept our outstretched hands as an evening sacrifice. Make us worthy to spend the night blamelessly, and fully sheltered against all evil; protect us against all disturbances or fear of the devil. Grant repentance to our souls and diligence to our minds, that we may understand your dreadful and just judgment; subdue our flesh with the fear of You, let our passions die out, so that in the stillness of night we may be enlightened by the thinking of Your precepts; keep afar from us all indecent dreams and harmful cravings; awaken us in time for prayer, strengthened in the faith and able to obey Your commands through the mercy and kindness of Your only-begotten Son, with Whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, always, now and for ever and ever. Amen.\n(Part II)\nCome, let us adore... (3x).",
