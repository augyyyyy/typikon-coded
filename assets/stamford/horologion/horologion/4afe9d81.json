  "content": "On Sundays, Feast days, and the final day or leave-taking of a feast, and when the Great Doxology is taken, the choir sings the following verses according to the tone of the first stichera at the praises.\nLet everything that lives and that breathes give praise to the Lord.* Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise Him in the heights.* To You is due a hymn, O God!\nPraise Him, all His angels,* praise Him, all His hosts.* To You is due a hymn, O God!\nIf the Lesser Doxology is taken, then we say:\nPraise the Lord from the heavens,* praise Him in the heights.\nPraise Him, all His angels,* praise Him, all His hosts.\nPraise Him, sun and moon,* praise Him, shining stars.\nPraise Him, highest heavens* and the waters above the heavens.\nLet them praise the name of the Lord.* He commanded: they were made.\nHe fixed them forever;* gave a law which shall not pass away.\nPraise the Lord from the earth,* sea creatures and all oceans,\nFire and hail, snow and mist,* stormy winds that obey His word;\nAll mountains and hills,* all fruit trees and cedars,\nBeasts, wild and tame,* reptiles and birds on the wing;\nAll earth’s kings and peoples,* earth’s princes and rulers,\nYoung men and maidens,* old men together with children.\nLet them praise the name of the Lord for He alone is exalted.* The splendor of His name reaches beyond heaven and earth.\nHe exalts the strength of His people.* He is the praise of all His saints, of the children of Israel, of the people to whom He comes close.",
