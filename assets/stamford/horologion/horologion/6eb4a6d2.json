  "content": "(Monday Evening)\nWhen I call, answer me,* O God of justice;\nFrom anguish You released me;* have mercy and hear me!\nO men, how long will your hearts be closed,* will you love what is futile and seek what is false?\nIt is the Lord who grants favors to those whom he loves;* the Lord hears me whenever I call Him.\nFear Him; do not sin:* ponder on your bed and be still.\nMake justice your sacrifice* and trust in the Lord.\n“What can bring us happiness?” many say.* Let the light of Your face shine on us, O Lord.\nYou have put into my heart a greater joy* than they have from abundance of corn and new wine.\nI will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once* for You alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.",
