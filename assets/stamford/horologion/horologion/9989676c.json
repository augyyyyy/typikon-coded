  "content": "(Monday and Thursday)\nO God, save me by Your name;* by Your power, uphold my cause.\nO God, hear my prayer;* listen to the words of my mouth.\nFor the proud have risen against me,* ruthless foes seek my life.\nThey have no regard for God.* But I have God for my help. The Lord upholds my life.\nLet the evil recoil upon my foes;* You Who are faithful, destroy them.\nI will sacrifice to You with willing heart* and praise Your name for it is good;\nFor You have rescued me from all my distress* and my eyes have seen the downfall of my foes.",
