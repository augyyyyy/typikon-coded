  "content": "(Tone 4): You raised Your friend on the fourth day, O Christ,* putting an end to the funeral hymns of Martha and Mary;* You revealed to all that You are truly the One Who fills the whole world* with Your divine presence, by Your own power and will.* The Cherubim praise You unceasingly:* Hosanna in the highest;* blessed are You, O supreme God, glory to You.\n\nVerse: Arise, then, Lord, lift up Your hand! O God, do not forget the poor!\n\nMartha said to Mary: The Master is here! He calls for you; go to Him! She hastened to the place where the Lord was, and seeing Him, she cried out, and bowing before Him she kissed His most pure feet and said: Lord, if You had been here, our brother would not have died.\n\nVerse: I will praise You, Lord, with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders.\n\n(Tone 8): In Bethany, You woke Lazarus from a sleep of four days;* when You came to the tomb,* the dead man was given life by Your command.* Hades trembled as it released him.* What a wonder, indeed!* O Lord of mercy, glory to You!\n\nGlory be: Now and for ever: O Lord, when You said to Martha: I am the resurrection,* You confirmed Your word of truth by Your deeds,* as You called Lazarus forth from Hades.* My passions have brought me down to death;* raise me up, I beseech You,* O Lover of Mankind and compassionate Lord.",
