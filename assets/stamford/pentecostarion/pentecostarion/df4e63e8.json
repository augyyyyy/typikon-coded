  "content": "Behold, the Bridegroom..., (p. 1251) without the theotokion.\n\nBehold, the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night. Blessed is the servant He finds awake. But the one He finds neglectful will not be worthy of Him. Beware, therefore, O my soul! Do not fall into a deep slumber, lest you be delivered unto death and the door of the kingdom be closed unto you. Watch instead and cry out: Holy, Holy, Holy are You, O God. Through the intercession of the Mother of God have mercy on us.\n\nLenten Sessional Hymns\n\n(Tone 1, Podoben – Hrob tvoj Spase): Today the holy passion rises like a light of salvation upon the world;* for Christ, Who loves us, is going to His suffering,* and He Who holds the universe in His hands,* is willingly nailed to the cross* for the salvation of the human race.",
