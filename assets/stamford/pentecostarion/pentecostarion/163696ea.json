(p. 1251) without the theotokion.\n\nLenten Sessional Hymns\n\n(Tone 4): O faithful, let us be on fire with love for the Bridegroom,* and with lamps burning, let us go out to meet Him.* May the light of our virtues shine brightly,* and may our faith be radiant.* With the wise virgins, let us prepare to enter the banquet hall of the Lord;* for the divine Spouse offers us all the crown of immortality.",
