  "content": "From the resurrectional tone of the week, then the following:\n\nGlory be: (Tone 6): I have wasted the treasure that my Father gave to me;* I have lived among senseless animals,* I have longed to eat the food of swine,* and because no one offered it to me I remained hungry.* But now I return to my Father Who is so good,* and with tears I cry out:* Treat me as one of Your servants,* for I no longer deserve Your love;* and in Your mercy, save me.\n\nNow and for ever: Christ the Lord, our Creator and Redeemer,* came forth from your womb, O most pure Virgin.* He clothed Himself in our human flesh* to set us free from the original curse of Adam.* Therefore, O Mary, we praise you, without ceasing,* as the true Virgin Mother of God,* and we sing with the angels:* Rejoice, O Lady, advocate, protector, and salvation of our souls.",
