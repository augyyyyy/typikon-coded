  "content": "From the resurrectional tone of the week and the following:\n\nGlory be: (Tone 5): Because of my sins my eyes are weighed down,* and I can no longer raise them up to see the light of heaven.* But grant that I may repent like the publican,* O Lord, have mercy on me.\n\nNow and for ever: O most pure Virgin,* you are the temple, the gate, the palace, and the throne of the King.* Christ, our Redeemer and Lord,* appeared through you to those who slumbered in darkness.* For He, as the Sun of Righteousness,* wished to enlighten those whom He created with His own hands* according to His own image.* Therefore, O Lady, whom we always praise in song,* we beseech you to intercede with Christ for the salvation of our souls;* for, as His Mother, you can approach Him with the greatest confidence.",
