  "content": "From the resurrectional tone of the week, then the following:\n\nGlory be: (Tone 8): Alas! O my darkened soul,* how long will you persist in sin?* How long will you lie in laziness?* Why do you not think of the dreadful hour of death?* Do you not fear the awesome judgment seat of the Savior?* How will you defend yourself?* How will you be vindicated?* Your works are there to convict you,* and your actions witness against you.* Moreover, time is growing short,* O my soul; hasten and cry out in faith:* I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned:* but I know Your love and Your mercy.* O Good Shepherd, in Your goodness,* do not deprive me of a place at Your right hand.\n\nNow and for ever: O Virgin, you have never known wedlock,* yet you conceived God in the flesh in a manner which words can never describe.* You thus became the Mother of God on high.* O Immaculate Lady, receive the supplication of your servants* and grant us the cleansing of our sins.* Accept now our prayers and beseech God to save all of us.",
