Though the tomb was sealed* You came forth from it, O Life;* and though the doors were closed* You came to Your disciples, O Christ our God,* You are the resurrection of all.* Through them You renew an upright spirit in us* according to the greatness of Your mercy.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O blessed Mother of God,* turn your gaze upon a helpless people and have mercy on us.* Pray that we do not perish in vain; beseech, O kind-hearted One, the merciful God,* that He save our souls, O most holy Virgin.\n\n2. Truly Life was placed in a grave,* and a seal was placed on the stone,* and the soldiers guarded Christ as they would a slumbering king.* The angels therefore glorified Him as the immortal God,* and the women cried out and said: The Lord is risen* and gives great mercy to the world.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O Virgin Mother of God,* intercede without ceasing with Christ our God,* Who was crucified for us and destroyed the power of Death,* that He may save our souls.",
