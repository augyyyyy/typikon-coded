When the tomb was shown to be open and Hades was lamenting,* Mary cried out to the apostles who were hiding and said:* Come out, laborers of the vineyard, proclaim the news of the resurrection;* for the Lord is risen, granting the world great mercy.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O Virgin and Theotokos, pray to your Son, Christ our God,* Who was willingly nailed upon the cross and rose from the dead,* that He might save our souls.\n\n2. Mary Magdalene stood by Your tomb and wept, O Lord.* When she thought You were the gardener, she said:* Where have you hidden the eternal Life?* Where have you placed Him Who sits on the throne of the Cherubim?* When she saw those guarding Him fearful and appearing as dead, she cried to them:* Give me my Lord or else cry out with me and say:* You have come forth from the tomb and raised the dead, O Lord, glory to You!\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O Theotokos, Gideon prefigured your conception,* and David interpreted your birthgiving.* As dew descended upon the fleece so the Word descended into your womb.* O holy Earth, who without seed gave birth to Christ our God,* the salvation of the world, you are full of grace.",
