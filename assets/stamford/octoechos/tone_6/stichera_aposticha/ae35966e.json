  "content": "O Christ our Savior,* the angels in heaven sing the praises of Your resurrection;* make us, on earth, also worthy* to extol and glorify You with a pure heart.\n\n*Verse:* The Lord reigns, He is clothed in majesty.\nAlmighty God, You destroyed the brazen gates and bars of Hades,* and raised up fallen mankind.* Therefore, with one accord, we cry out:* O Lord, risen from the dead, glory to You!\n\n*Verse:* For He has made the world firm, which shall not be moved.\nChrist willed to renew us from our corruption of old* by being nailed to a cross and placed in a tomb.* When the women came to anoint His body they tearfully cried out:* O, what sorrow afflicts us!* O Savior of all, how could You consent to occupy a grave?* If You truly willed this, then why did You allow Your body to be stolen?* How were You removed? What place now conceals Your life-bearing body?* O Lord, appear to us as You promised* and put an end to our tears.* As they were lamenting, an angel appeared and cried out to them:* Do not weep, but tell the apostles that the Lord is risen,* granting sanctification and great mercy to the world.\n\n*Verse:* Holiness befits Your house, O Lord, for length of days.\nO Christ, You were crucified of Your own free will,* and by Your burial You imprisoned Death.* As God, You rose in glory on the third day,* granting life and great mercy to the world.\n\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Christ the Lord, our Creator and Redeemer,* came forth from your womb, O most pure Virgin.* He clothed himself in our human flesh* to set us free from the original curse of Adam.* Therefore, O Mary, we praise you, without ceasing, as the true Virgin Mother of God,* and we sing with the angels:* Rejoice, O Lady, advocate, protector, and salvation of our souls.",
