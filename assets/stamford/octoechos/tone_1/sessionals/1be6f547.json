The soldiers guarding Your tomb, O Savior,* became as dead men at the lightning flash of the angel* who appeared to announce Your resurrection to the women.* We glorify You, for You have cleansed us from corruption.* We fall down before You, for You rose from the tomb, our only God.\n\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* We acknowledge you as the Mother of God,* and after giving birth you remained truly a virgin.* We eagerly seek refuge in your goodness;* for we sinners have taken you as our intercessor,* and in temptations we find salvation in you;* for you alone are all pure.\n\n2. The women who came to Your tomb early in the morning* trembled at the sight of the angel.* The tomb shone with life,* and they were struck with astonishment.* Therefore, they returned to the apostles, proclaiming the resurrection.* Christ, Who alone is mighty and powerful,* has despoiled Hades and raised all those held in corruption.* He has released us from the fear of condemnation* by the power of the cross.\n\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* O Mary, the precious dwelling of the Lord,* lift us from the abyss into which we have fallen* and deliver us from dreadful despair, from our faults, and from all affliction;* for you are the refuge of sinners.* You are the help, the protection, and the safety of your servants.",
