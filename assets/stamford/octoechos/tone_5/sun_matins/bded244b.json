Let us praise the honored cross of the Lord;* let us venerate His holy burial with hymns;* let us glorify His holy resurrection.* For He raised the dead from the graves because He is God.* He despoiled the might of Death and broke the power of Satan,* and He shed light on those who are in Hades.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* In you, O all pure Virgin, we recognize a marvelous wonder of conception* and unspeakable manner of birthgiving.* It astounds our minds and shocks our understanding.* Your glory, O Mother of God, is known to all* for the salvation of our souls.\n\n2. You were accounted among the dead, O Lord,* even though You put to death the Prince of death.* You were placed in a grave although You emptied the graves.* On earth the soldiers guarded the tomb,* but below, You raised the dead who from ages past, had fallen asleep.* Therefore, O Lord, the almighty and incomprehensible One, glory to You!\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Rejoice, O holy mountain which the Lord ascended!* Rejoice, O living bush, unconsumed by the fire!* Rejoice, only bridge reaching from the world to God and leading the dead to eternal life!* Rejoice, O pure One, free of corruption;* you gave birth without the aid of man to the Savior of the world!",
