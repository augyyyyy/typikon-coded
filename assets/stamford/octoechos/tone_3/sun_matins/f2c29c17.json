  "content": "Together let us praise the apostles as eye-witnesses of the Word,* divine preachers, spiritual fishers of the nations,* for they have manifestly brought us to the understanding of Christ;* and delivering the human race from deception,* they have rendered us worthy of the kingdom.\nGlory be: Now and for ever: Even before being brought to judgment, my conscience condemns me,* and I, wretch that I am, tremble at the thought of the verdict,* considering my countless sins.* Therefore, with compunction, I cry out to you,* O invincible intercessor and protectress:* Deliver me from that shame,* and save me through your prayers.\n\nTogether let us praise the apostles,* for they preached the true doctrine of the Lord to all,* dispelling the gloom of heresies* and shining forth in the world the light of the Spirit through the teaching of grace;* and they pray for us.\nGlory be: Now and for ever: Having found you to be a haven, a bulwark, a refuge, hope and protection,* and fervent help, we, the faithful flee to you,* and earnestly cry out with faith:* Have mercy, O Theotokos, upon those who place their trust in you,* and deliver us from transgressions.",
