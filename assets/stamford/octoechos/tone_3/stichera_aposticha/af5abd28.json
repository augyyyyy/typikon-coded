O Word, lead me into Your life.\nThose who sow in tears for God in dry land* shall reap as they sing for joy, as they gather the sheaves of eternal life.\nGlory be: Now and for ever: From the Holy Spirit shines every perfect gift,* as from the Father and the Son; in Him all creation lives and moves.\n\nProkimenon: Ps 95\nProclaim to the nations: God is king. The world He made firm in its place.\nVerse: O sing a new song to the Lord, sing to the Lord all the earth.\n\nCanon\n\nHirmos 1: In days of old He gathered the waters in a single pool, and with a divine stroke, He divided the sea for the people of Israel; He is our God and is greatly glorified. To Him alone do we offer our hymns, for He is covered with glory.\n\nHirmos 3: You draw all things out of nothing; You create them by Your Word; and by Your Spirit, You bring them to perfection. O Master all-powerful, strengthen me in Your love.\n\nHirmos 4: O Lord, You have shown us Your sovereign love by delivering Your only Son to death for us. In thanksgiving, we cry out to You: Glory to Your power, O Lord!\n\nHirmos 5: Before You I keep watch for the dawn, O Creator of the world and peace that surpasses every spirit. Your precepts are light; guide me by their paths.\n\nHirmos 6: Encircled by the bottomless pit of my sins, I felt my breath failing me; raise Your hand, reach out to me and save me, O Master, as You saved Peter; for You are the One Who walks on the waters.\n\nHirmos 7: Formerly You poured out dew upon the three youths in the fire of the Chaldeans; now with the resplendent fire of Your divinity, enlighten us who cry out to You: Blessed are You, O Lord, God of our ancestors.\n\nHirmos 8: Thrown into the blazing fire without being harmed by the flames, and remaining firm in their faith, the youths sang a divine hymn: Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord, praise and exalt Him forever!\n\nOde 9 – Hirmos: A new wonder, worthy of God! The Lord has truly passed through the closed gate of the Virgin. He entered the world naked, and at His departure we see Him clothed in the flesh; yet the door has remained closed. The one who is Mother of God we now extol beyond words.\n\nVerse: Glory to Your holy resurrection, O Lord!\nIt is dreadful to see the Creator and the Word of God hanging on the cross. Our God suffers in the flesh for His servants, and lifeless, He is placed in the tomb; yet He delivers the dead from Hades. O Christ, the almighty One, we extol You.\n\nVerse: Glory to Your holy resurrection, O Lord!\nPlaced in the tomb as one dead, O Christ; You saved our ancestors from death; You raised the dead and make life flourish once more; with Your own hand, You lead the human race toward the light and clothe them with divine immortality. O inexhaustible Source of light, we extol You.\n\nGlory be: Now and for ever: You are the throne and the temple of God, and the Most High has made His dwelling in you; O most pure One, you gave birth without seed, and the gate of the flesh was not opened.

How have You been stolen, O King of all?* From within the grave two angels bearing the message of life cried out to her saying:* Woman, why are you weeping?* She answered: I cry because they have removed my Lord from the grave,* and I do not know where they have taken Him.* But as she turned around and saw You, she said:* My Lord and my God, glory to You!\n\nVerse: I will praise You, Lord, with all my heart;* I will recount all Your wonders.\nThe soldiers enclosed Life in the tomb,* but the thief opened paradise with his word by saying:* For my sake, You have been crucified with me and have hung on the tree of the cross;* You have appeared to me sitting on the throne with the Father.* You are Christ our God Who gives great mercy to the world.\n\nGlory be: Gospel Stichera.\nNow and for ever: You are truly most blessed...

(p. 34).\nGreat is the power of Your cross, O Lord;* for though it was raised in one place, it acts throughout the world.* It made apostles of fishermen, and martyrs of the Gentiles.* We beg them to intercede for our souls.\nGlory be: Now and for ever: O Mother of God! O intercessor of all who pray to you!* We have confidence because of you;* we boast because of you, and all our hope is in you!* In behalf of your worthless servants,* implore Him Who was born of you.\n\nMONDAY MATINS\n\nSessionals\n\nWhile still on earth, O my soul, do penance;* for dust does not chant hymns in the grave, nor does it deliver from sin;* Therefore, cry out to Christ God:* You Who know the hearts of all, I have sinned against You!* Before You judge me, have mercy on me, O God, and save me!\nGlory be: Now and for ever: O Mother of God, our protection and strength,* powerful helper of the world!* Through your prayers deliver your servants from every misfortune,* O only blessed One.\n\nAt the dread judgment I shall accuse myself without denouncers,* and shall condemn myself without witnesses;* for the books of my conscience will be opened,* and my secret deeds will be exposed.* Therefore, O God, before You examine my deeds at that public trial,* cleanse and save me.\nGlory be: Now and for ever: Rejoice, O Mary, Virgin Mother,* holy mountain, garden of Eden, from whom was born Christ God,* the seedless Word, from Whom life had sprouted forth* for the world.\n\nCanon – Ode 9\n\nHirmos: On Mount Sinai Moses beheld in the bush you who conceived the fire of the Divinity within your womb without being consumed; Daniel saw you as the unhewn mountain and the budding rod, and Isaiah cried out: from the root of David!\nVerse: Glory be to You, our God, glory be to You!\nIn days of old, Jacob acquired the birthright because of temperance, while Esau gave up his right as the firstborn, because he did not restrain his stomach. How evil is intemperance, and how great is abstinence! Flee, therefore, my soul, from evil deeds, and love what is good.\nVerse: Holy archangels and angels, pray to God for us!\nStanding now before the great and supreme Light, O divine angels of God, you have become powerful advocates of all of us who glorify you.\nGlory be: Now and for ever: We all know that you are the foundation of our salvation, for your most pure birthgiving has saved those who in faith sing to you and glorify you, O Mother of God!\n\nAposticha\n\nBring together my scattered mind, O Lord,* and purify my hardened heart;* grant me the repentance of Peter,* the sigh of the publican,* the tears of the adulteress,* so that I may cry out to You with a loud voice:* O God, save me, for You alone are kind-hearted and love mankind.\nVerse: In the morning..., (p. 146).\nWhen I am praying,* I frequently I see myself committing sin,* for while I am singing hymns with my lips, my soul is thinking foolish things.* Correct both through repentance,* O Christ, and save me.\nVerse: Let the favor of the Lord...
