The noble Joseph* took down Your most pure body from the cross;* he wrapped it in a clean shroud* and with fragrant spices laid it in burial in a new tomb.* But You arose in three days, O Lord,* bestowing great mercy upon the world.\n\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* We praise you, O Mother of God, for you are covered with glory more than any other.* Death has been put to death* and Hades trampled underfoot by the cross of your Son.* He raised us from death, granting us eternal life.* Paradise is again offered for us to enjoy as before.* Therefore, in thanksgiving* we glorify the love and power of Christ our God.\n\n2. The angel appeared to the myrrh-bearing women at the tomb* and said: Ointments are for the dead,* but Christ has been shown to be free from all corruption.* Rather, cry out instead:* The Lord is risen, granting great mercy to the world.\n\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Being dispensed from the laws of nature,* you preserved your virginity in your divine birthgiving.* For you alone gave birth to the One Who existed before you before time began;* for this reason, we extol you, O Mother of God!",
