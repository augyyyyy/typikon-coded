The myrrh-bearing women looked into the entrance of the tomb,* and because they could not bear the brilliance of the angel,* they trembled in astonishment, and said:* has He, who opened paradise to the thief, been stolen;* or is He, Who proclaimed His resurrection before His passion, now risen?* Truly, Christ is risen,* granting resurrection and life to those in Hades.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* We extol you, O Mother of God, singing:* You are the mountain from which was hewed the rock that crushed the gates of Hades.\n\n2. *(Pododen: Zdyvuvavsia Josyf):* You suffered crucifixion willingly, O Savior,* and mortals placed You into a new tomb,* even though You established the ends of the world with a word.* Death, our enemy, was bound and defeated through Your life-giving resurrection.* All those held captive in Hades cried out: Christ is risen.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever: (Samopodoben):* Your betrothed and guardian, O Theotokos,* was amazed and perplexed when he beheld the mystery of your conception without seed.* But he recalled the rain falling on the fleece,* and the bush burning with fire but not consumed,* and the blossoming rod of Aaron;* thus he testified before the priests and cried out:* A Virgin gives birth and still remains a virgin.",
