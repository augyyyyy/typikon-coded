You have risen from the dead, O Life of all,* and a resplendent angel said to the women:* Dry your tears and proclaim the good news to the apostles,* and cry out in praise that Christ the Lord is risen,* and as God He was pleased to save the human race.\n*Glory be: Now and for ever:* Let us glorify the tabernacle and the heavenly gate,* the most holy mountain and the shining cloud,* the heavenly ladder and the mystical paradise,* the deliverance of Eve and the precious and great treasure of the universe.* For through her, salvation came to the world,* and the ancient debt was forgiven.* Therefore, we cry out to her:* Intercede with your Son and God to grant forgiveness of sins* to those who bow in true worship to your most holy birthgiving.\n\n2. Mortals have sealed Your tomb, O Savior,* but angels rolled the stone away from Your grave;* and the women witnessed Your resurrection from the dead.* They proclaimed to Your disciples in Zion* that You arose and broke asunder the bonds of death, O Life of all.* O Lord, glory to You!\n*Glory be: Now and for ever: (is sung standing):* In you, O Full of Grace,* the angelic choirs and the human race, all creation rejoices.* In you, O sanctified temple, mystical paradise, and glory of virgins,* from whom God took flesh,* He Who is our God from before all ages, became a child.* For He made your womb a throne and made it greater than the heavens.* In you, O Full of Grace, all creation rejoices:* Glory be to you! Glory be to you! Glory be to you!",
